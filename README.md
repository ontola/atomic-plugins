# atomic-plugins

This repo is now the source of truth for all atomic plugins.
https://github.com/ontola/atomic-server/tree/develop/integrations is
deprecated.

- `integrations/` — `ontola/atomic-server`'s former `integrations/` folder.
- `devonian/` — the `devonian` npm package (bidirectional lenses for data
  portability), migrated in from the standalone `localthought/devonian`
  repo with its history intact.
- `reflector/` — the sync-engine/plugin-runtime layer above syncables,
  migrated in from the standalone `localthought/reflector` repo with its
  history intact.
- `syncables/` — the `syncables` npm package (OpenAPI-driven mock server and
  sync client), migrated in from the standalone `localthought/syncables`
  repo with its history intact.
- `overlays/` — OpenAPI Overlays for real providers and the `catalog.json`
  that `integration-proxy/` composes, migrated in from the standalone
  `localthought/overlays` repo with its history intact, and published by
  GitHub Pages at https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/.
- `openapi-extensions/` — the OpenAPI extension specs (Pagination Schemes,
  CRUD Causality, Authenticated Principal and draft proposals) that
  `overlays/`, `syncables/` and `integration-proxy/` implement, migrated in
  from the standalone `pondersource/openapi-extensions` repo with its
  history intact.
- `integration-proxy/` — the Rust OAuth/API proxy (LocalThought) that drive
  apps reach through atomic-server's `store.proxy`. See its own
  [README](integration-proxy/README.md) and [AGENTS.md](integration-proxy/AGENTS.md).
  To run your own instance instead of atomic.place's, see
  [integration-proxy/SELF_HOSTING.md](integration-proxy/SELF_HOSTING.md).

See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for how to work in each.

## Plugins

Every plugin below is **experimental**: its capabilities are declared, not
verified, until they have current live evidence (see
[`integrations/README.md`](integrations/README.md#one-certification-command)).
[`integrations/READINESS.md`](integrations/READINESS.md) is the per-plugin
matrix: which runtime the current code uses, how it is installed on the
pinned atomic-server (`.atomic-server-ref`, `bae5cdbe3`), its scope, and
which evidence is unit, host E2E, live or historical.

In short, at that pin: the Pets and Notion drive apps import through the
host's `store.proxy` and pass a host E2E against a mock proxy, but
no host UI installs them from the catalog yet
([#94](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/94)). Bank statements
is set up and fed files through the host's generic file entry point, after a
manual publish to the server's store. The other plugins have no reachable
entry point at the pin; each has a linked issue.
The one-line descriptions below come from
[`integrations/catalog.json`](integrations/catalog.json), except GitHub
issues, which has no catalog entry.

Screenshots are tracked in
[#49](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/49). None is taken yet.
