# integration-proxy

A Rust web server that holds OAuth grants and pasted API keys and tokens for third-party
platforms, and forwards catalog-allowlisted requests to them on behalf of
[Atomic](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-server) agents.

There are no proxy accounts, logins or tenants (issue
[#54](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/54)). The account is
the caller's Atomic agent, `atomic:agent:<public key>`: every request that
matters is signed with that key, and the proxy verifies it against the key
inside the id, so it looks nothing up. A **connection** (one provider grant)
is owned by the agent that redeemed it; the owner **delegates** it to app
agents, and may register **runtimes** (a node's app agent) for them. A plugin
frame, which cannot keep a key, uses a short-lived **capability** signed by
the owner and bound to a key the frame holds in memory.

PostgreSQL stores connections (provider credentials sealed with
XChaCha20-Poly1305), delegations, runtimes, five-minute connect handoffs and
the single-use record of signed requests.

Built with [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum), following the OAuth 2.0
Authorization Code flow with PKCE towards providers.

**To run your own instance**, see [SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md):
installing (`cargo install`, Docker, systemd), configuration, PostgreSQL TLS,
a reverse proxy, registering OAuth apps, pointing Atomic Server and the data
browser at it, upgrades, backups and health checks. This README describes
the protocol and the code.

## How it works

### Identity

Agent ids are accepted as `atomic:agent:<key>` or the legacy
`did:ad:agent:<key>`, with `<key>` in either base64 alphabet, padded or not.
They are converted to one canonical form, `atomic:agent:` plus the unpadded
base64url key, before they are stored or compared, and only that form is
ever returned. Only Ed25519 keys exist today; one function
(`agent_id::parse`) is where another algorithm would be added.

### Request signatures (Atomic v2)

Every signed request carries Atomic's own headers:

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `x-atomic-agent` | the signer's agent id |
| `x-atomic-public-key` | the signer's Ed25519 public key, base64 |
| `x-atomic-timestamp` | Unix milliseconds |
| `x-atomic-signature` | base64 Ed25519 signature over the message below |
| `x-atomic-signature-version` | `2` |

The signed message is five lines joined by `\n`, with no trailing newline:

```text
atomic-request-v2
{METHOD}
{full URL, including query}
{timestamp, exactly as in x-atomic-timestamp}
{lowercase hex SHA-256 of the body; e3b0c442…b855 when empty}
```

The proxy accepts version 2 only; a missing or different version header is
refused, never retried as v1. The agent must be `atomic:agent:` of the public
key header. The timestamp must be within ±5 minutes of the proxy's clock, and
each signed message is accepted once (a SHA-256 of it is kept for ten
minutes).

**Full URL** is `BASE_URL` followed by the request's path and query exactly as
received, e.g. `https://localthought.io/proxy/<id>/github-issues/user/repos?page=2`.
It is never rebuilt from the `Host` header: behind a TLS-terminating reverse
proxy or platform router the process sees plain HTTP. Clients sign the URL they fetch (`new URL(u).href`).
`BASE_URL` must therefore be exactly the public origin clients use.

### Routes

- `GET /` — a static landing page. `GET /catalog` lists the platforms;
  `GET /catalog/{platform}.yaml` returns a platform's composed OpenAPI
  document.
- `GET /connect?platform=<p>&redirect_uri=<url>&code_challenge=<S256>&code_challenge_method=S256`
  — the consent page, naming the platform and the destination. No login.
  `redirect_uri` must be `https`, loopback `http`, or the Atomic app's deep
  link (`atomic://…`); it may not carry `connection_code` or `error`
  parameters, credentials or a fragment.
- `POST /connect/authorize` — the consent form (cookie-bound CSRF token,
  single use). For an OAuth platform it answers `200` with a page that
  continues to the provider (a `<meta>` refresh plus a button, sent with
  `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`) rather than redirecting: the consent page's
  CSP `form-action` governs a form submission's whole redirect chain, and a
  provider whose authorization endpoint first redirects to another origin of
  its own (Notion's API host to its app host, for one) would be blocked. The
  consent page therefore allows form submissions to the proxy only. 0.2.2
  and later; 0.2.1 redirected (`303`). For an API-key platform (`type:
  apiKey` in the composed document) the consent page asks for the key, and
  this seals it and redirects (`303`) to `redirect_uri`. When the scheme
  declares `x-api-key-details`
  ([`openapi-extensions/spec/api-key-details`](../openapi-extensions/spec/api-key-details/README.md),
  0.2.3 and later), the page shows the scheme's `description` and links its
  `helpUrl` (a plain link that opens in a new tab), and this first calls the
  declared `keyCheck` operation once with the key: a fixed `GET` on the
  document's own `https` server, no redirects, 10-second timeout. A `401`
  or `403` answers the consent page again (`200`) saying the key was not
  accepted, without spending the consent; any other non-2xx, a redirect or
  no answer is a `400` and nothing is stored. One consent page makes at
  most 5 key checks (unreleased): the fifth rejection spends it and answers
  `400` "Too many attempts to enter a key for this connection; start again
  from your hub", and nothing is checked for it after that. This bounds one
  consent page, not a client: anyone can open a new one. Across consent
  pages, one client network makes at most `KEY_CHECK_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` (default
  20) key checks per platform in any hour (unreleased); over that, the
  answer is `429` "Too many key checks from your network for <Platform>; try
  again later" with `Retry-After`, before any key check and without spending
  the consent (SECURITY.md). A 2xx may give a label (at most
  200 characters, sealed with the connection). A platform whose scheme is
  `type: http` with `scheme: bearer` or `scheme: basic` (unreleased; see
  "HTTP tokens" below) works the same way: the page asks for an API token
  (and, for some Basic layouts, a username), the key check is sent the
  `Authorization` header a proxied request would carry, and a rejected token
  is asked for again with "did not accept that API token". For a platform whose
  composed document declares top-level `security: []` and no security scheme
  (0.2.3 and later), the consent page asks for nothing, and this hands off a
  connection that holds no credential and redirects (`303`) to
  `redirect_uri`; requests are forwarded with none. Approving the same
  consent page twice answers `400` "You already approved this connection …"
  rather than "expired"; the page's one inline script (allowed by its hash)
  disables the button after the first click.
- `GET /oauth/{platform}/callback` — the provider's callback. Only the
  browser that approved consent can complete it. It redirects to
  `redirect_uri?connection_code=<handoff>` (or `?error=access_denied`). The
  handoff is not a credential: it is single-use, valid five minutes, and
  bound to the PKCE challenge.
- `POST /connect/redeem` — **signed**; body
  `{"code": "<handoff>", "code_verifier": "<PKCE verifier>"}`; answers
  `{"connection_id", "platform", "owner", "label"?}`. The signer becomes the
  owner. `label` is there when an API-key platform's key check gave one.
  A wrong verifier does not burn the handoff.
- `ANY /proxy/{connection_id}/{platform}/{path}` — **signed** by the owner, a
  delegated app agent, or a registered runtime of a delegated app; or carrying
  a frame capability (below). The proxy attaches the provider credential,
  refreshing an expiring OAuth token (one refresh in flight per connection),
  and forwards only catalog-allowlisted methods and paths. The caller's
  `Authorization` and `x-atomic-*` headers are never forwarded: an
  `Authorization` other than `Capability …` is refused with
  `401 unsupported_authorization`, and a capability is consumed by the proxy.
  `Link`,
  `Retry-After`, `ETag`, `X-Total-Count` and `X-Next-Page` come back unchanged.
- `GET /connections` — **signed**; the signer's connections with their
  delegations (`agent`, `label`, `created_at`, `last_used_at`), and the
  signer's runtimes. Never credentials. Shape:
  `{"owner", "connections": [{"connection_id", "platform", "owner", "label"?, "created_at", "last_used_at", "delegations": [...]}], "runtimes": [{"agent", "app", "label", "created_at", "last_used_at"}]}`.
  A connection's `label` is the key check's label (see `/connect/authorize`),
  absent otherwise.
- `DELETE /connections/{id}` — **signed by the owner**; deletes the connection
  and its delegations. `204`.
- `POST /connections/{id}/agents` — **signed by the owner**; body
  `{"agent", "label"?}` delegates the connection to that app agent.
  `DELETE /connections/{id}/agents/{agent}` removes the delegation. `204`.
- `POST /runtimes` — **signed**; body `{"app", "agent", "label"?}` registers
  `agent` (a node's app agent) as a runtime of installation `app` for the
  signer. `DELETE /runtimes/{agent}` removes it. A runtime can use every
  connection its app is delegated.
- `GET /healthz` — `200 ok` when the database answers.

Delegations and runtimes are read on every proxied request, so removing one
takes effect on the next request. A connection is deleted after 90 days
without an authenticated request (`CONNECTION_IDLE_DAYS`).

### Frame capabilities

A plugin frame (null origin, no storage) generates a non-extractable key in
memory; its page, which holds the user's key, signs a capability for it:

```text
Authorization: Capability <payload>.<sig>
payload = base64url(JSON), unpadded:
          {"v":2,"connection_id","platform","aud","app","cnf","exp"}
sig     = the connection owner's Ed25519 signature, base64, over
          "integration-proxy-capability-v2\n" + the JSON bytes
```

`aud` is the proxy origin (`BASE_URL`'s scheme, host and port); `app` is the
installation's app agent, which must hold a delegation; `cnf` is the frame's
key as `atomic:agent:<key>`; `exp` is Unix seconds, at most 15 minutes ahead.
The request itself must also carry v2 headers signed by `cnf`'s key, so a
copied capability is useless without the frame. The proxy checks, in order:
the owner's signature, `aud`, `exp`, `connection_id` and `platform`, the
delegation for `app`, and the request signature by `cnf` (with skew and
replay). On `401 capability_expired` the frame asks its page for a new one.

### Errors

Signed endpoints answer errors as JSON, `{"error": "<code>", "message": "<text>"}`:

| Status | `error` |
| --- | --- |
| 401 | `missing_signature`, `unsupported_signature_version`, `invalid_agent`, `agent_key_mismatch`, `stale_timestamp`, `bad_signature`, `replayed`, `unsupported_authorization` (e.g. a retired `Bearer` connection code), `invalid_capability`, `capability_expired`, `capability_too_long`, `wrong_audience`, `capability_key_mismatch`, `credential_refresh_failed` (connect again) |
| 403 | `not_owner`, `not_delegated`, `capability_scope`, `platform_mismatch`, `access_denied` |
| 404 | `unknown_connection` (deleted, idle-expired, or never existed: connect again) |
| 400 | `bad_request`, `invalid_handoff` |

Catalog refusals and upstream failures from `/proxy/…` keep their plain-text
bodies (`404 method or path is not in the catalog`, `502 upstream request failed`).

### Who may use the proxy

Every signed request's connection owner (and the redeemer, at
`/connect/redeem`) is checked against an `AccessPolicy`. Delegated agents and
frames are checked as their owner, so limits count per owner. The default
policy admits every agent except those in `REVOKED_SUBJECTS`, and only those
in `ALLOWED_AGENTS` when that is set. The atomic.place deployment is meant to
plug in a lookup of the agent's SaaS account and tier
([`build_app_with_access`](#library-crate)); how an agent is linked to an
account is decided in ontola/atomic-saas#138 and is **not** implemented here.

### What was removed (flag day)

Issue #54 decision 6 switched these off with no migration: OIDC application
login (`/auth/login`, `/auth/callback`, `/auth/logout`, `APP_AUTH_*`), API
identity login (`/auth/login/{platform}`, catalog `tenantIdentity`),
`tenant:v1:` tenants, tenant secrets and `SERVER_SECRET`, `/session`, the
legacy signed `/connect` and `/oauth/{platform}/start`, the `/proxy`
tenant-secret check, the `user_id` and `credentials` parameters of
`/connect`, and rotating connection codes (`Authorization: Bearer` and
`X-Connection-Code`). Existing connection codes stop working; users connect
again. The old `connection_codes` and `oauth_states` tables are no longer
read or written but are not dropped automatically; once the new version is
deployed, an operator may drop them with
`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS connection_codes, oauth_states;`.

## Setup

### 1. Configure environment variables

Nothing in the process reads `.env` files; export the variables, or load a
`.env` into your shell first (`set -a; source .env; set +a`).

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BASE_URL` | no | Public URL of the proxy, e.g. `https://localthought.io`. Defaults to `http://localhost:8080`. Used for OAuth callback URLs, as the prefix of every signed URL, and (its origin) as a capability's `aud`. Must be exactly what clients use. |
| `PORT` | no | Port to listen on. Defaults to `8080`. |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | no; set it in production | Secret for the short-lived consent and OAuth-binding cookies. If unset, a random key is generated at startup (with a warning in the log), and a consent screen open during a restart must be started again. Instances behind one name must share it. |
| `CATALOG_PATH` | no | Local path or HTTPS URL for the catalog JSON. Defaults to `https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/catalog/2026-10-02-auth-profiles.json`, this repository's `overlays/catalog/2026-10-02-auth-profiles.json` as GitHub Pages publishes it from `main` (0.2.4 defaults to `catalog/2026-10-02.json`). |
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | PostgreSQL connection URL. See the TLS note below. |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | yes | Base64url-encoded, random 32-byte key for sealed provider credentials. Changing it makes every stored connection unreadable. |
| `REVOKED_SUBJECTS` | no | Comma-separated agent ids (any accepted spelling) the default access policy refuses. |
| `ALLOWED_AGENTS` | no | When set, comma-separated agent ids; the default access policy admits only these owners. |
| `OPERATOR_NAME` | no | Who runs this proxy, as the landing and consent pages name them. Defaults to `this integration proxy`, and the pages then name no one. The consent page also shows the host of `BASE_URL`. 0.2.1 and later. |
| `OPERATOR_URL` | no | Absolute `http(s)` link for `OPERATOR_NAME` on those pages. Anything else (`javascript:`, a relative path, credentials in the URL) is refused at startup. 0.2.1 and later. |
| `KEY_CHECK_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` | no | The most API key or token checks the consent form makes for one client network and platform in any hour (a sliding window, counted in PostgreSQL across instances). Defaults to `20`; `0` turns the limit off; more than `10000` stops the proxy at startup. Only platforms with a declared key check count. A client over it gets `429` and no key check. A network is an IPv4 address or an IPv6 /64. Unreleased. |
| `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED` | no | `true` creates the webhook inbox's tables and runs its sweeper (ontola/atomic-plugins#369, step 2; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md#webhook-inbox-369-unreleased)). Unset, empty or `false` (the default): no inbox table, no sweeper, no webhook route. Any other value stops the proxy at startup. No webhook route is mounted in this release either way. Unreleased. |
| `WEBHOOK_INBOX_MAX_BYTES` | no | The deployment's inbox budget in bytes, payloads plus a stated per-row overhead. Defaults to `1073741824` (1 GiB); at least `268435456` (the per-owner budget). Read only with `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=true`: with the inbox off it is ignored, even when invalid. Unreleased. |
| `TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR` | no; `heroku` on Heroku | Where that limit finds the client address: `none` (default) uses the TCP peer and ignores `X-Forwarded-For`; `heroku` (synonym `rightmost`) uses only the right-most `X-Forwarded-For` entry, which Heroku's router (or one reverse proxy in front) appends, and never an entry to its left; when that entry is missing or not an address, one shared bucket. Set `heroku` only behind such a proxy: without one, a client writes that entry itself. Unreleased. |
| `OAUTH_<PLATFORM>_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_<PLATFORM>_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_<PLATFORM>_CLIENT_AUTH_METHOD` | per OAuth platform | See below. |

OAuth credentials are provider-specific. For a catalog platform named
`google-calendar`, configure `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_ID` and
`OAUTH_GOOGLE_CALENDAR_CLIENT_SECRET`; its callback URI is
`<BASE_URL>/oauth/google-calendar/callback`. Provider names use lowercase
letters, digits, and hyphens, and are converted to uppercase with hyphens
replaced by underscores for environment-variable names.

The server owns the OAuth endpoints and scopes for every platform in the
catalog, reading them from that platform's composed OpenAPI document; a
request cannot supply a provider URL, token URL, or scope.

The PostgreSQL client validates the database's TLS certificate against the
system roots when TLS is used; `sslmode` in `DATABASE_URL` decides whether it
is (`prefer` by default, which falls back to plaintext against a server
without TLS). Use `?sslmode=disable` for a PostgreSQL on the same host and
`?sslmode=require` across any network; see
[SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md#database_url-and-postgresql-tls). A managed
PostgreSQL may set `DATABASE_URL` for you (Heroku's Postgres add-on does).
Schema setup runs in a transaction under an advisory lock, so several
instances can start against an empty database at once.

## Catalog

Per-platform OAuth app registration for any deployment is in
[SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md#registering-oauth-apps). Every callback is
`<BASE_URL>/oauth/<platform>/callback`; the examples below use the
localthought.io deployment's `BASE_URL`.

Discord uses `OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET`,
with callback `https://localthought.io/oauth/discord/callback` on localthought.io.
Register an OAuth application in the Discord Developer Portal. The catalog
composes Discord's full OAD, which declares a bot token and OAuth together,
and selects its `discordUser` authentication profile (see "Authentication
profiles" below): the read-only integration uses `identify` and `guilds` to
read your profile and import server memberships, and every other Discord
operation, including all bot-token operations, is refused. It does not
import messages or require a bot token. This is declared from Discord's
documentation and composition tests; no live Discord connection has been
verified with the profile.
The guild import requests `limit=200`, covering Discord's documented maximum
number of guilds for a user. The profile endpoint is available as a read
operation, not an imported collection.
Discord access tokens expire and use the existing refresh-token flow.

Spotify uses `OAUTH_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and the callback
`<BASE_URL>/oauth/spotify/callback` (on localthought.io,
`https://localthought.io/oauth/spotify/callback`). Register a
Spotify Web API app with that exact redirect URI. The integration uses
Authorization Code with PKCE, so no client secret is required or transmitted;
the catalog declares only `none`, so the proxy neither requires nor sends
one (`OAUTH_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_AUTH_METHOD=none` is equivalent). It imports playlists with `playlist-read-private` and
`playlist-read-collaborative`; no write scopes are requested. No account ID
parameter is needed. Development-mode access is subject to Spotify's Premium
and app-user allowlist requirements. Access tokens refresh automatically;
expired or revoked refresh tokens require reconnecting through OAuth.


Moneybird uses `OAUTH_MONEYBIRD_CLIENT_ID` and
`OAUTH_MONEYBIRD_CLIENT_SECRET`, with callback
`<BASE_URL>/oauth/moneybird/callback`. Register an
external OAuth application, rather than a personal API token. The
`sales_invoices` scope grants access to contacts (Moneybird has no contacts-only
scope). The initial integration imports contacts; supply the administration ID
from the Moneybird account when connecting. OAuth tokens without `expires_in`
remain usable until revoked; tokens with an expiry use the normal refresh flow.

[`overlays/catalog/2026-10-02-auth-profiles.json`](../overlays/catalog/2026-10-02-auth-profiles.json) in this repository
(migrated from the former `localthought/overlays` repository) is the source of
the integration catalog. GitHub Pages publishes `overlays/` from `main` at
`https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/`, and the proxy defaults to
the `catalog/2026-10-02-auth-profiles.json` there; set `CATALOG_PATH` to another HTTPS URL or to a
local fixture for development. Each platform names one pinned OpenAPI document
(in `localthought/` or `ontola/openapi-directory`, at a commit) and zero or more Overlay
Specification documents, each served from that same Pages folder. At startup
the proxy downloads those HTTPS sources, applies each overlay's `update`
actions in the listed order, and keeps the resulting YAML in memory.

Provider overlay filenames include their kind and full OAD commit SHA under
`overlays/APIs/`, so adding a newer OAD revision leaves existing catalog
selections intact. Each overlay's `extends` identifies that same pinned OAD.
The loader rejects a mismatched declaration before applying actions, resolves
relative `extends` against the overlay URL, and continues to support older
overlays that omit it. Published revision files are immutable; updating a
platform means explicitly changing its `openapi` and ordered `overlays`
selections together.

A catalog entry may also contain a **selection** object. Consumer
**query_overrides** remain separate from the composed OpenAPI document:
choosing to include archived records is client configuration, not an API
default. The proxy passes those choices through.
**selection.oauthSecurityScheme** is trusted server configuration: when a
document contains multiple OAuth authorization-code Security Schemes, it names
the one the proxy uses. The value must be a string naming a declared scheme.
**selection.authenticationProfile** is trusted server configuration too: it
names one of the document's `components.x-authentication-profiles`
(see "Authentication profiles" below), and excludes
`oauthSecurityScheme`, `apiKeySecurityScheme` and `httpSecurityScheme`.
**selection.apiKeySecurityScheme** and **selection.httpSecurityScheme** do the
same as `oauthSecurityScheme` for a document with several `apiKey` schemes,
or several bearer/basic `http` schemes.
**GET /catalog/{platform}.selection.json** returns the selection object (or an
empty object when absent).

### Authentication profiles

A document that declares more than one kind of security scheme (OAuth and an
API key, say) is refused unless the catalog entry selects an authentication
profile ([`x-authentication-profiles`](../openapi-extensions/spec/authentication-profiles/README.md),
0.1.0-draft). A profile names one security scheme. With
`selection.authenticationProfile` set, the proxy:

- connects with that scheme only: `oauth2` with an authorization-code flow,
  `apiKey`, or a bearer or basic `http` scheme (the last two with their
  `x-api-key-details` help link and key check, as for any API-key or token
  platform);
- asks for the scopes of the operations the profile covers, and of no other:
  an operation is covered when its effective `security` has a requirement
  whose only member is the profile's scheme;
- answers `404 method or path is not in the catalog` for every operation the
  profile does not cover, without sending any credential upstream, including
  operations that accept only anonymous access, only another scheme, or the
  scheme only combined with another;
- refuses an unknown profile, an undeclared or unsupported scheme, a profile
  that covers no operation, or a selection that also names a scheme, instead
  of falling back to anything else;
- sends a stored OAuth token only while the platform still resolves to an
  OAuth scheme, so a selection moved to an API-key profile does not send a
  user's token to that profile's operations (the person connects again). A
  stored bearer or basic token is likewise sent only while the platform
  resolves to an `http` scheme of the same kind.

Declaring profiles in a document changes nothing until a catalog selects
one. The served document (`GET /catalog/{platform}.yaml`) is the whole
composed document; a client reads which operations its connection reaches
from their `security`. Without a profile selection the proxy behaves as
before.

### HTTP tokens (bearer and basic)

Unreleased (Decision Inbox Q-086). A security scheme of `type: http` with
`scheme: bearer` or `scheme: basic` (case-insensitive) is a user credential,
like an `apiKey` scheme: a personal access token pasted on the consent page.

- **Which documents.** Without an authentication profile, an `http` scheme
  counts only when the document declares no `oauth2` and no `apiKey` scheme.
  A document that has one of those resolves exactly as before, whatever
  `http` schemes it also declares (OAuth documents often declare `http`
  `basic` for client authentication at their token endpoint). With several
  bearer/basic schemes, `selection.httpSecurityScheme` names one. A profile
  may name a bearer or basic scheme of any document. Other `http` schemes
  (`digest`, ...) are not supported.
- **Bearer.** The page asks for one token. After trimming it must be 4 to
  512 bytes of RFC 6750 `b64token` (`[A-Za-z0-9-._~+/]+=*`), where `:` is
  also allowed before the padding, for Asana-style personal access tokens
  (`2/<id>/<id>:<secret>`, as Asana documents them; not checked with a live
  token). Requests carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- **Basic.** The scheme must declare how the token fills the credential, as
  `x-api-key-details.basicCredentials`
  ([`api-key-details`](../openapi-extensions/spec/api-key-details/README.md)
  0.2.0-draft, section 4.3); a basic scheme without it is not offered
  ("This platform is not available for connection"). The three layouts:
  `{token: username, password: <fixed, may be empty>}` (one field),
  `{token: password, username: <fixed>}` (one field), and
  `{token: password, usernameLabel: <label>}` (a text field with that label
  for the username, then the token field). There is no layout in which the
  person types a password other than the token. The token must be 4 to 512
  bytes without control characters; as a username it may not contain `:`.
  A typed username must be 1 to 256 characters without control characters
  or `:`. Requests carry `Authorization: Basic base64(username:password)`.
- **Key check, help and sealing.** `x-api-key-details` `helpUrl` and
  `keyCheck` work as for an API key; the check is sent the same
  `Authorization` header the proxied requests will carry. The connection
  seals the token (and, for Basic, both halves as they were checked) in the
  same per-row envelope as an API key or OAuth token, and the handoff, redeem
  and listing never return them.
- **Requests.** The proxy sends a stored bearer or basic credential only
  while the platform still resolves to an `http` scheme of that same kind
  and, for credentials stored by the unreleased version, with the same
  scheme name and (Basic) the same declared layout (its fixed halves and
  which half is the token; not the username field's label). API keys stored
  by it are bound to their scheme name and to the scheme's `in` and `name`
  (header names case-insensitive) the same way. Otherwise it answers
  `401 credential_refresh_failed` (connect again). Credentials stored
  before carry no binding and are sent as before.
  The caller's own `Authorization` is never forwarded (above).

Overlay URLs use immutable OAD-revision filenames. Publish new overlay
filenames and a new dated catalog together, then explicitly switch
`CATALOG_PATH` or the proxy default to that dated catalog; `Overlays CI` and
this crate's `default_catalog_*` tests (which compose the checked-in catalog,
reading the Pages-published overlays from `../overlays/`) validate it before
merge; after merge, `Overlays published` checks that Pages serves the merged
bytes; then restart the service. OAD URLs remain pinned to an
`openapi-directory` commit. Overlay content cannot currently be pinned: a
`CATALOG_PATH` pointing at a local file or at a commit's
`raw.githubusercontent.com` copy of `catalog.json` still lists Pages URLs, so
its overlays are whatever `main` serves when the proxy starts.

### 2. Run it

```sh
cargo run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` (or your configured `BASE_URL`). For a
deployment, see [SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md); `GET /healthz` is the
health check.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all       # format
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings   # lint
cargo build            # build
cargo test             # test
```

CI runs the same checks on every push and pull request that touches
`integration-proxy/` (see the repository's
`.github/workflows/integration-proxy-ci.yml`), plus `cargo package --locked`
and a build of the [Heroku wrapper template](examples/heroku-wrapper/).

## Library crate

This package is published to crates.io as
[`atomic-integration-proxy`](https://crates.io/crates/atomic-integration-proxy)
(library `atomic_integration_proxy`, binary `integration-proxy`), so a
deployment can be a thin wrapper that depends on it by semver instead of a
copy of the source. The public API is intentionally small; everything else is
private and may change in any release:

| Item | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `Config`, `Config::from_env()` | All configuration, read from the environment variables described above. |
| `DEFAULT_CATALOG_PATH` | The pinned catalog URL used when `CATALOG_PATH` is unset. |
| `build_app(&Config) -> Result<axum::Router, Error>` | Loads the catalog, connects to PostgreSQL, returns the router (CORS and tracing layers included), with the default `EnvAccessPolicy`. |
| `build_app_with_access(&Config, Arc<dyn AccessPolicy>)` | The same, admitting connection owners through a custom policy (e.g. a SaaS account and tier lookup). |
| `AccessPolicy`, `Access`, `AllowAll`, `EnvAccessPolicy` | The admission check asked about every owner; `AllowAll` for a self-hosted proxy. |
| `AgentId`, `parse_agent_id` | A parsed agent id; `as_str()` is the canonical `atomic:agent:` form. |
| `serve(Config) -> Result<(), Error>` | `build_app`, then bind `0.0.0.0:{PORT}` and serve, recording each request's peer address (`into_make_service_with_connect_info::<SocketAddr>()`) for the key-check limit. A caller that serves `build_app`'s router itself should do the same; without it, and without a trusted `X-Forwarded-For`, all clients share one limit. |
| `TrustForwardedFor`, `DEFAULT_KEY_CHECK_LIMIT_PER_HOUR` | `Config::trust_forwarded_for` and the default of `Config::key_check_limit_per_hour`. Unreleased. |
| `WebhookConfig`, `DEFAULT_WEBHOOK_INBOX_MAX_BYTES` | `Config::webhooks` (`WEBHOOKS_ENABLED`, `WEBHOOK_INBOX_MAX_BYTES`); `#[non_exhaustive]`, so build one with `WebhookConfig::default()` and set its fields. Unreleased. |
| `run() -> ExitCode` | What the binary does: init `tracing` from `RUST_LOG` (default `info`), `Config::from_env`, `serve`, print any `Error` to stderr. |
| `Error` | Startup/serve failure; `Display` is the one-line message the binary prints. |

A complete wrapper `main.rs` is:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> std::process::ExitCode {
    atomic_integration_proxy::run().await
}
```

The only runtime file access is `CATALOG_PATH` when it is set to a local
path; the default is a pinned HTTPS URL, and `static/` is compiled into the
binary, so the crate needs no files next to the executable.

### Publishing the crate

`.github/workflows/integration-proxy-publish.yml` publishes when a tag
`integration-proxy-v<version>` matching `Cargo.toml`'s `version` is pushed.
It reruns fmt, clippy and the full test suite (including the PostgreSQL tests)
first, then publishes through crates.io Trusted Publishing. crates.io only
allows Trusted Publishing to be configured on a crate that already exists, so
0.1.0 must be published once by hand by whoever will own the crate; the
workflow header lists the one-time crates.io settings. To release:

```sh
# bump `version` in integration-proxy/Cargo.toml, merge, then on main:
cd integration-proxy && cargo publish --dry-run
git tag integration-proxy-v0.1.1 && git push origin integration-proxy-v0.1.1
```

Only `src/`, `static/index.html`, `static/logo.png`, `Cargo.toml`,
`Cargo.lock`, `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `SECURITY.md` and `LICENSE` are packaged
(`cargo package --list` shows the exact list). `tests/` fixtures are not, so
`cargo test` only works from a checkout of this repository.

### The localthought.io deployment (Heroku)

This section is about one deployment, not a requirement: the crate runs on
any host that provides the environment variables, one HTTP port and
PostgreSQL ([SELF_HOSTING.md](SELF_HOSTING.md)). localthought.io runs on
Heroku from the separate repository
`localthought/integration-proxy`, which since its PRs #77 (wrapper) and #78
(0.2.1 from crates.io) holds only the [`examples/heroku-wrapper/`](examples/heroku-wrapper/) files
and depends on `atomic-integration-proxy` from crates.io. A change merged here
reaches production only after it is published (see "Publishing the crate")
and that repository's `Cargo.lock` is bumped:

```sh
# in a localthought/integration-proxy checkout, once <version> is on crates.io
# (raise the requirement in Cargo.toml too when the deployment needs it)
cargo update -p atomic-integration-proxy
cargo build --release --locked
git commit -am "Deploy atomic-integration-proxy <version> from crates.io"
```

Merging that to its `main` deploys. Do not copy this source tree there: the
wrapper is the whole repository now.

0.3.0 limits key checks per client network
(`KEY_CHECK_LIMIT_PER_HOUR`). On Heroku every request's peer address is the
router's, so set `TRUST_FORWARDED_FOR=heroku` before deploying it, or all
clients share one limit (the proxy logs a warning at startup when it finds
Heroku's `DYNO` variable without it).

From 0.2.1 the landing and consent pages no longer say "LocalThought"
unless told to: set `OPERATOR_NAME=LocalThought` and
`OPERATOR_URL=https://localthought.io` (Heroku config vars) to keep naming
it, or leave both unset for the neutral "this integration proxy".

#### Deploying 0.2 (issue #54 flag day)

0.2 changes the client protocol; deploy it together with the atomic-server
release that signs requests (Atomic v2) and uses `/proxy/{connection_id}/…`,
never before it. Environment (on Heroku, config vars):

| Variable | Change |
| --- | --- |
| `BASE_URL` | **Check**: must be exactly the public origin clients use (for production `https://localthought.io`, no trailing path). Every signature covers it; a mismatch makes every signed request fail with `bad_signature`. |
| `APP_AUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `APP_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `APP_AUTH_AUTHORIZATION_URL`, `APP_AUTH_TOKEN_URL`, `APP_AUTH_USERINFO_URL`, `APP_AUTH_LABEL`, `APP_AUTH_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE` | No longer read; unset them (on Heroku, `heroku config:unset …`). 0.1 refused to start without the first five; 0.2 ignores them. |
| `SERVER_SECRET` | No longer read; unset it. |
| `REVOKED_SUBJECTS` | Now means agent ids; tenant ids and OIDC subjects listed there no longer match anything. Rewrite or unset it. |
| `ALLOWED_AGENTS` | New, optional: restrict the proxy to these owners. |
| `SESSION_SECRET`, `DATABASE_URL`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `CATALOG_PATH`, `PORT`, `OAUTH_*` | Unchanged. |

Existing connection codes stop working at deploy; users connect again. After
the deploy, `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS connection_codes, oauth_states;` removes the
old sealed credentials (optional, irreversible).

## Security

Provider credentials are sealed per connection row (the associated data
binds each envelope to its row) and never returned to a client. Requests go
only to catalog-allowlisted methods and paths. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)
describes the controls and what is not yet verified.

## Notes on state

- Nothing identifies a browser session: there are no session cookies. The
  consent screen and the OAuth callback use two short-lived (10 minute)
  encrypted `Secure`/`HttpOnly`/`SameSite=Lax` cookies: `platform_consent`
  (the pending request and CSRF token) and `platform_oauth` (binding the
  callback to the approving browser). Provider state, handoffs and
  connections live in PostgreSQL, so any instance can serve any request.
- With `WEBHOOKS_ENABLED=true`, the webhook inbox keeps its subscriptions,
  retained payloads, per-owner receipts, usage counters and hook cleanup jobs
  in PostgreSQL too, every one of them bounded (SECURITY.md, "Webhook
  inbox"). With it off, none of these tables exists.
- Cookies are marked `Secure`, so in production `BASE_URL` must use
  `https://`. `http://localhost` works during local development because
  browsers treat `localhost` as a secure context.

## Browser clients

CORS allows any origin, including a plugin frame's `null` origin, to send
`Authorization`, `Content-Type`, `If-Match` and the five `x-atomic-*` headers,
and exposes `Content-Type`, `Link`, `Retry-After`, `ETag`, `X-Total-Count` and
`X-Next-Page`. Cookie credentials are not enabled for CORS; consent remains a
top-level browser navigation.

## Todoist

The `todoist` platform imports projects and active tasks through Todoist API v1
with the read-only `data:read` scope. Configure `OAUTH_TODOIST_CLIENT_ID` and
`OAUTH_TODOIST_CLIENT_SECRET`, and register
`<BASE_URL>/oauth/todoist/callback` as the OAuth redirect URL.
New Todoist applications issue expiring access tokens and rotating refresh
tokens; the proxy stores and refreshes these through its existing credential flow.
Legacy non-expiring access tokens are also supported. No provider writes are exposed.

Provider documentation: https://developer.todoist.com/api/v1/

## Redirect-flow regression checks

```sh
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test
# Isolated local PostgreSQL, never a production database:
TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgres://postgres@localhost:15439/connect_test?sslmode=disable' \
OAUTH_GITHUB_ISSUES_CLIENT_ID=fixture-client OAUTH_GITHUB_ISSUES_CLIENT_SECRET=fixture-secret \
  cargo test -- --include-ignored
```

CI provides PostgreSQL and includes the database tests; [TESTING_COVERAGE.md](TESTING_COVERAGE.md) maps each verification step to its tests. Live Google/GitHub authorization and a hub import must be verified against matching deployed revisions of the proxy and atomic-server; local fixture checks do not establish live access.

### OAuth client registration

Integration authorization and token endpoints and required scopes are read
from the composed OpenAPI catalog. A platform with one OAuth
authorization-code Security Scheme uses it directly. A platform with multiple
such schemes must set the catalog's trusted
**selection.oauthSecurityScheme**; missing, non-string, or unknown selections
fail closed. A mixed-kind platform uses the scheme of its selected
authentication profile instead (see "Authentication profiles"). Requests
cannot select a scheme, a profile or supply endpoints. Scopes are
taken from operation security requirements (falling back to root
requirements), not every scope supported by the server. Public operations
require no scopes; unsupported authentication combinations fail closed.

`OAUTH_<PLATFORM>_CLIENT_AUTH_METHOD` optionally overrides the client authentication method: `none`, `client_secret_post`, or `client_secret_basic`. When omitted, the proxy selects the **first usable method in the declared array order** of `x-oauth-authentication-details.authorizationServerMetadata.token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported` in the selected OAuth security scheme. It skips methods the proxy does not implement and methods incompatible with the referenced token/refresh operations. If the array declares no usable method, configuration fails rather than silently falling back.

When that metadata is absent, the proxy retains `client_secret_post` for compatibility, except when a referenced token or refresh operation requires HTTP Basic authentication: it then uses `client_secret_basic`. Explicit overrides must still be supported by the metadata and token operations; an invalid override is an error, not a request to auto-select.

For example, Notion advertises only `client_secret_basic`, so its `_CLIENT_AUTH_METHOD` setting can be omitted. For `["private_key_jwt", "none", "client_secret_basic"]`, the proxy skips the unimplemented JWT method and chooses `none`. Array order is this proxy's default-selection policy, not an assertion of provider preference or the client's registered method. Set the override when your client registration requires a different advertised method. Public clients use `none` and do not load or send a secret; confidential methods require `_CLIENT_SECRET`. Missing credentials cause an error and do not trigger selection of another method. Authorization uses S256 PKCE unless trusted metadata explicitly declares PKCE unsupported.

The proxy implements a bounded subset of
**x-oauth-authentication-details**. It reads inline
**token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported**,
**code_challenge_methods_supported**, PKCE requirements, and fixed
authorization profile parameters. Parameter references must be local. Schema
validation supports **type**, **enum**, recursive **items**, **properties**,
**required**, and **additionalProperties**; other validation keywords fail
closed. Serialization supports scalar form values, form/space/pipe-delimited
scalar arrays, and form/deep-object scalar objects. Reserved OAuth fields and
query-name collisions are rejected.

The proxy does not fetch **oauth2MetadataUrl** and does not interpret
**tokenEndpointOperation** or **refreshEndpointOperation**. A selected scheme
that contains any of those fields is rejected, because discovery or a
separately described operation could require different token-request
authentication or wire behavior.

Upgrading from 0.1 is a flag day (issue #54, decision 6): see
[What was removed](#what-was-removed-flag-day). Provider callback URLs and
`OAUTH_*` variables do not change; `APP_AUTH_*` and `SERVER_SECRET` are no
longer read and can be unset. Clients must move to signed requests at the
same time.
