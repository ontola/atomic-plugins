# syncables

This code is open source and was produced by Michiel de Jong, using Claude as a tool.
Michiel de Jong has signed off on all the code in this repo line-by-line (except for
the lockfiles, which were produced by npm and pnpm), and Michiel de Jong is the
publishing author in terms of copyright.
This work was [funded by NLNet](https://nlnet.nl/project/TUBS/).

Reads an OpenAPI document and gives you:

- a **mock API server** that implements it, backed by a real (in-memory)
  CRUD store per resource, seeded with fake data generated from the
  document's schemas;
- an **API client** that talks to any server implementing that OpenAPI
  document and keeps a local copy of each resource collection in sync.

## Usage

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

```ts
import { loadOpenApiDocument, createMockServer, createApiClient } from 'syncables';

const document = await loadOpenApiDocument('./petstore.yaml');

const server = createMockServer(document);
const { url } = await server.listen();

const client = createApiClient(document, { baseUrl: url });
await client.sync(); // pulls every discovered resource collection into local storage

const pets = await client.list('/pets');
```

A "resource" is any pair of an OpenAPI collection path and its matching
item path, e.g. `/pets` and `/pets/{petId}`. Paths without that pairing
(health checks, one-off actions, etc.) are served from their documented
examples/schemas but aren't treated as syncable resources.

## Keeping in sync

`sync()` is safe to call on a timer: it conditionally re-fetches using
`ETag`/`Last-Modified` (or a fallback comparison against the previous sync
when a server doesn't support conditional requests) and only touches local
storage for items that actually changed.

```ts
const handle = client.startPolling({
  intervalMs: 30_000,
  onSync: (result) => console.log('changed:', result.changed),
  onError: (error) => console.error('sync failed:', error),
});

// later
handle.stop();
```

## Writing

`create`/`update`/`remove` are local-first: they update local storage
immediately and return, then apply themselves against the server in the
background, retrying on failure until they succeed.

```ts
const pet = await client.create('/pets', { name: 'Milo', tag: 'cat' });
// `pet` is already in local storage — the POST to the server is still
// happening (and retrying, if needed) in the background.

client.pendingWrites('/pets'); // writes not yet confirmed by the server
```

## Reading in a browser: `syncables/browser`

`syncables/browser` is the read path on its own, for code that runs in a
browser or a sandboxed iframe. It imports no Node built-ins and no
`js-yaml`, and it never calls `fetch` itself: every request goes through a
`Transport` function you pass in, e.g. a plugin host's `request()` into an
integration proxy. A test bundles it with esbuild `platform: 'browser'`
and fails on any Node built-in import. It does not include the mock
server, `createApiClient`, or the file-path loaders, so pass documents and
overlays as parsed objects.

```ts
import {
  prepareDocument,
  describePlatform,
  readPlatform,
  type Transport,
} from 'syncables/browser';

const document = prepareDocument(openapiJson, [paginationOverlay, crudOverlay]);
describePlatform(document); // { parameters, collections, upstream }

const transport: Transport = async ({ url, method, headers, body }) =>
  host.request({ path: url.pathname + url.search, method, headers, body });
// -> { status, headers, body } with the body as text

const { records, ontology, errors } = await readPlatform(document, {
  platform: 'notion',
  constants: {}, // values for describePlatform(document).parameters
  transport,
});
```

- **Collections** come from `components.crudResources` (the
  [CRUD Causality Extension](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/tree/main/openapi-extensions/spec/crud-causality),
  usually added by an overlay). A nested collection runs once per parent
  record, with its path variables filled in through `identity.bindings`. On a
  collection, `x-list-query` adds fixed query parameters, `x-list-method: POST`
  lists with a POST instead of a GET, and `x-list-body` adds fixed JSON body
  fields.
- **Pagination** follows the operation's pagination scheme: page numbers or
  offsets, page tokens or cursors, and next links in the body or a `Link`
  header. A cursor declared in `request.bodyFields` travels in the JSON body
  of a POST. Notion's `/v1/search` and `/v1/databases/{id}/query` work this
  way (`start_cursor` in the request, `next_cursor` in the response). A next
  link to another origin, or a page that repeats, stops that collection with
  an error.
- **Records and ontology**: `deriveOntology` makes one class per resource and
  one property per field, typed with Atomic Data datatype URLs. Each record's
  `values` are keyed by property shortname, and `date-time` strings are
  converted to epoch milliseconds.
- **Limits** (`DEFAULT_READ_LIMITS`): 10,000 requests, 5,000 records and 30
  minutes per read, plus at most 3 retries of a 429 per request, each after
  its `Retry-After`. When a limit is reached, the read stops. It keeps the
  records read so far and reports the stop in `errors`.

`paginate(document, { transport, path, method, pathParams, query, body,
pageSize })` walks every page of one operation, without `crudResources`.
The main `syncables` entry exports the same functions, with `paginate`
renamed `paginateOperation` so it doesn't clash with `ApiClient.paginate`.

## Changelog

- **0.18.0**: Adds the `syncables/browser` entry point: a browser-safe read
  path with an injected transport. Adds request-body pagination, with
  `buildBody` and body-field `offset`/`page` roles in `nextCursor`.
  `applyOverlay` moves to a module without file-system access. The Node API
  is unchanged, and `syncables` also exports the read-path functions.

## NLnet milestone 1

This package is the reference implementation for
[milestone 1](https://github.com/tubsproject/syncables/blob/main/nlnet-milestones.md#1-syncables)
of the project's NLnet grant, which is split into two parts:

- **Part a) Read-only version** — `createApiClient`'s [`sync()`/`paginate()`](#keeping-in-sync)
  pull a full local-first copy of a resource collection (walking pagination in
  full, then re-fetching conditionally on later calls) into a pluggable
  `StorageAdapter`, from nothing but the OpenAPI document — see `discoverResources`
  (`src/resources/discover.ts`) for how "syncable" resources are found in it.
- **Part b) Full bidirectional version** — the [`create`/`update`/`remove`](#writing)
  methods make that copy writable, not just readable: each write lands in local
  storage immediately, then applies itself against the server in the background
  through a per-record retry queue (`src/client/client.ts`), so the local
  copy can be both pulled *and* pushed, as the milestone describes.

## Generative AI use

syncables is developed collaboratively with **Claude Code** (Anthropic), an
agentic coding assistant: a human directs the design and reviews, edits, and
tests the changes it proposes before they're committed.

As an NLnet-funded project, this follows
[NLnet's Generative AI policy](https://nlnet.nl/foundation/policies/generativeAI/):

- Commits produced with AI assistance carry a `Claude-Session: <url>`
  trailer identifying the session that produced them.
- [`docs/ai-logs/`](docs/ai-logs) holds prompt/output disclosure logs for
  sessions going forward, redacted for secrets and personal information, per
  the policy's terms for a project that was already ongoing before the
  policy took effect (no retroactive backfill of every past session; known
  historical session links are indexed as pending in
  [`docs/ai-logs/pending-historical-sessions.md`](docs/ai-logs/pending-historical-sessions.md)).
- AI-drafted content is reviewed and edited by a human before being
  committed; it is not represented as unassisted human work.
