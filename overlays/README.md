# overlays
OpenAPI Overlay files that complete existing OpenAPI files with Pagination Schemes and other additions

## Where this lives and how it is published

This folder was migrated from the standalone `localthought/overlays`
repository (full history via `git subtree`, from its `main` plus its
`calendar-events-write-back-prod` branch, which the integration proxy's
production catalog pinned). Author new overlays here, not there.

GitHub Pages publishes this repository's `main` from its root (legacy
build; the root `.nojekyll` makes it serve every file byte-for-byte), so
any file `overlays/<path>` is served at:

```
https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/<path>
```

`catalog.json` lists each platform's overlays by those URLs, and the
integration proxy's default `CATALOG_PATH` is
`https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/catalog.json`. Before this
migration every overlay URL was pinned to a `localthought/overlays` commit
on `raw.githubusercontent.com`; the Pages URLs are not pinned, so a merge
to `main` changes what the proxy composes at its next start. The OAD
(`openapi`) URLs are still pinned to an `openapi-directory` commit
(`localthought/`, or `ontola/` for Google Calendar).

Overlays are applied in the order `catalog.json` lists them, and an action
whose target does not exist yet fails the whole catalog load. Clockify's
`crud-causality-overlay.yaml` is listed first because it defines the
projects/users paths its auth and pagination overlays target, and the
two setup reads the timesheets app makes (`GET /v1/user`, `GET
/v1/workspaces`); those stay in the read overlays. Its
`time-entry-write-overlay.yaml` is listed last and carries its own
`security`, so removing that one line returns Clockify to read-only; it adds
create (`POST`), full-replacement update (`PUT`) and delete on time entries
for the timesheets app's two-way sync (ontola/atomic-plugins#123). Its
request shapes follow Clockify's published reference and are not verified
against a live account.

GitHub Issues' `repositories-read-overlay.yaml` comes right after its
pagination overlay, whose `nextLink` scheme it names, and carries its own
`security`: it adds `GET /user/repos`, the issue-tracker drive app's
repository picker (ontola/atomic-plugins#147), as a plain read, not a
`crudResources` collection. The same app's two label writes, adding one
label to an issue (`POST .../issues/{issue_number}/labels`) and removing one
(`DELETE .../labels/{name}`), are in `crud-causality-overlay.yaml` as partial
updates of `issue`; there is no endpoint that replaces or lists an issue's
labels. All three use the `repo` scope the GitHub OAuth app already asks
for, which covers issue labels and private repositories, so the requested
scope is unchanged. Their shapes follow GitHub's REST reference and are not
verified against a live account.

The `pets` platform (ontola/atomic-plugins#174) is different: there is no
third-party API behind it. `pets-demo/1.0.0/openapi.json` is its whole
document, authored here rather than pinned from `openapi-directory`, so it
has no overlays. Its server is
`https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/pets-demo/1.0.0/api`, and
the one operation it declares, `GET /pets`, is the static file
`pets-demo/1.0.0/api/pets` (five synthetic pets, one page, no `Link`
header; Pages serves it as `application/octet-stream`). It declares
top-level `security: []` and no security scheme, which
`atomic-integration-proxy` 0.2.3 and later connect without a credential;
0.2.2 and earlier list the platform but refuse to connect it. The Pets drive app
bundles the same document (`integrations/pets/app/openapi.json`). A change
to either the document or the data is a change to what live users of the
demo read, so give it a new version folder rather than editing `1.0.0` in
place.

Checks:

- `.github/workflows/overlays-ci.yml` (PRs): every catalog overlay URL, and
  every OAD URL under the Pages base, maps to a file in this folder, and the
  tests below pass (`tests/test_identity_overlays.py` also checks the pets
  demo's document and data). It reads the
  Pages-published sources from the checkout, so it validates a change before
  Pages serves it.
- `integration-proxy`'s `default_catalog_*` tests (PRs touching this folder):
  compose this `catalog.json` with the proxy's runtime loader, reading
  overlays from this folder.
- `.github/workflows/overlays-published.yml` (after each Pages build): the
  served `catalog.json`, every overlay and Pages-published OAD it lists, and
  the pets demo's data match the built commit.

## Authenticated principal overlays

The Google Calendar and GitHub Issues identity overlays add a current-principal
operation without making it a collection or assigning CRUD metadata. The
catalog is the trusted identity selection and associates it with its ordinary
OAuth scheme. Google uses either `googleOnline` or `googleOffline`; GitHub
uses `githubOAuth`. Before rollout, an operator upgrading an existing
Google-login deployment explicitly sets
`APP_AUTH_IDENTITY_NAMESPACE=https://accounts.google.com` to retain the prior
tenant mapping. This is operator-only configuration; there is no default and
callers cannot choose an identity namespace.

For example, the Google Calendar catalog entry selects:

```json
{
  "oauthSecurityScheme": "googleOffline",
  "tenantIdentity": {
    "operationId": "getGoogleAuthenticatedPrincipal",
    "namespace": "https://accounts.google.com"
  }
}
```

GitHub uses `githubOAuth`, `getGitHubAuthenticatedPrincipal`, and
`https://github.com`. Merely adding the extension to an OpenAPI document does
not enable tenant login; the trusted catalog must select the operation.

Google's overlay is applied after its auth overlay because it adds `openid`,
`email`, and `profile` to both `googleOnline` and `googleOffline`. GitHub's
overlay is also applied after `auth-overlay.yaml`, which declares `githubOAuth`.
The overlays only describe the provider endpoints and response metadata; the
runtime supplies its normal User-Agent header and bearer token.

The Google declaration follows its [OpenID Connect discovery and UserInfo
reference](https://developers.google.com/identity/openid-connect/reference).
The GitHub declaration follows the [authenticated-user endpoint](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/users/users#get-the-authenticated-user)
and GitHub's [durable numeric-ID guidance](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/oauth-apps/building-oauth-apps/best-practices-for-creating-an-oauth-app).

Validate the full catalog compositions, from this folder, with
`python tests/test_identity_overlays.py` after installing
`requirements-identity-tests.txt`. Generate proxy regression fixtures with
`python tests/generate_identity_catalog_fixtures.py --output <fixture-directory>`;
the generated `sources.json` records the source URLs and content hashes.
Both read overlays under the Pages URL from this checkout and download only
the pinned OADs.
