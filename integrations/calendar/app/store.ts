/**
 * The `store` a drive plugin's `view({ root, store })` receives, provided by
 * the host at runtime (atomic-server `server/src/plugins/assets/view-client.js`,
 * served from `/plugin-ui?format=client`) and never bundled here. Kept in
 * sync with that file by hand; if they disagree, view-client.js is ground
 * truth.
 *
 * A copy of `integrations/pets/app/store.ts`, with the operations of pin
 * 007869464 (`openExternal`, `openResource`, `getTheme`, `onThemeChange`,
 * `proxy.disconnect`; typed in atomic-server's `@tomic/plugin`) as optional
 * members. Calendar is the first app to
 * use `ifMatch`: view-client.js sends it to the proxy as `If-Match`. Kept
 * per plugin on purpose (strict per-plugin containment).
 *
 * `proxy` (ontola/atomic-plugins#54 phase 2): the frame names a platform and
 * a connection id, never a credential. view-client.js makes an Ed25519 key in
 * the frame's memory, gets a short-lived capability for it from the page
 * (signed with the user's key, after the page checked the connection is
 * delegated to this app), and calls the integration proxy directly, signing
 * each request with that key. It is feature-detected, never assumed.
