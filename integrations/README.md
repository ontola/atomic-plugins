# Integration maintenance

Each provider lives in its own directory; implemented plugins ship a bundled
ES module. The runtime, permissions, reconciliation and recovery stay shared.
Packages remain
experimental until their advertised capabilities have current live evidence.
[READINESS.md](READINESS.md) records, per plugin, which runtime its current
code uses, how it is installed on the pinned atomic-server, and which of its
evidence is unit, host E2E, live or historical.

Named actions, automation permissions, recovery and MCP setup are documented in
[ACTIONS.md](ACTIONS.md). Those are atomic-server features; the MCP stdio
protocol test (`browser/data-browser/scripts/integration-mcp.test.mjs`) lives
in atomic-server and is not run by this repo's CI.

## Local setup

Implemented packages import atomic-server's `browser/` tree by relative path
(`../../browser/lib/src/...`, `../../browser/tsconfig.build.json`,
`../../browser/node_modules/...`), which does not exist in this repo. From the
repository root, once per clone or worktree and again after
`.atomic-server-ref` changes:

```sh
node integrations/tooling/link-atomic-server.mjs
```

What it does, each step idempotent:

1. Makes `$ATOMIC_SERVER_CHECKOUT` (default `/tmp/atomic-server`) an
   atomic-server checkout at the commit in `.atomic-server-ref`. If the
   directory is missing it fetches just that commit (`--depth=1`). If the
   checkout is on another commit it fetches and detaches to the pinned one.
   It refuses if the checkout has uncommitted changes to tracked files.
2. Symlinks `browser` -> `$ATOMIC_SERVER_CHECKOUT/browser` and
   `integrations/node_modules` -> `../browser/e2e/node_modules`. Both are
   gitignored. It replaces a stale symlink but never a real directory.
3. Runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in `$ATOMIC_SERVER_CHECKOUT/browser`.
   atomic-server pins `pnpm@10.15.1` in `packageManager`.
4. Verifies the result: `browser/` must resolve into a git checkout at the
   pinned commit, and `browser/node_modules/.bin/tsc` must exist.

Flags: `--check` only runs step 4 and exits 1 on any problem. `--no-fetch`
skips step 1 and still verifies the commit. `--no-install` skips step 3.
CI's `shared-checks`, `lane` and `e2e-plugin-system` jobs run it with
`--no-fetch --no-install` after their own `actions/checkout` and
`pnpm install`, so the local layout is CI's layout. `run-lane.mjs` prints the
step-4 problems as warnings before it runs implementation tiers.

With that in place, no server is needed for:

```sh
node integrations/tooling/run-lane.mjs <lane> --tier typecheck   # tsc -p integrations/<lane>/tsconfig.json
node integrations/tooling/run-lane.mjs <lane> --tier unit        # vitest run --config integrations/<lane>/vitest.config.ts
node integrations/tooling/certify.mjs --layer js                 # every package (see below)
```

Not covered by the script:

- the atomic-server binary. The `live` and `e2e` tiers need it; build it
  once in the checkout with the `cargo build` line `serve.mjs` prints, or
  set `ATOMIC_SERVER_IMAGE` to run the published
  `ghcr.io/ontola/atomic-server-e2e:<pin>` image in Docker instead (AGENTS.md,
  "Shared pinned atomic-server build").
- certify's `--layer sandbox` and `--layer all` (the default is `--layer js`). Both run
  `cargo test -p atomic-server` from this repo's root for the Rust tests
  named in each `package.json`'s `atomicCertification.sandboxTests`. That
  has not been verified to work in this symlinked layout, and it cannot pass
  at the current pin: atomic-server `4bab16ee6` removed those tests. CI runs
  `--layer js` only.

## Server protocol scaffolds

A protocol assessment may begin as `integrations/<id>/plugin.json` and a
README, with a `contract` tier in `lanes.json`. This is planning metadata,
not a runtime manifest or installable release. Declare `status: scaffold`,
`runtime: quickjs`, the scope, proposed host capabilities, tracking issue
and first interoperability milestone. The README records host requirements
and an implementation checklist. Run its check with:

```sh
node integrations/tooling/run-lane.mjs <id> --tier contract
```

This tier needs only Node locally. CI selects it through the same per-folder
lane filters as implemented plugins. Passing validates the planning contract
and documentation; it does not execute QuickJS, prove protocol interoperability
or produce certification evidence. Add implementation tiers as code lands.
QuickJS executes JavaScript, not native Rust crates; native extensions or
sidecars require a separate placement decision (see below). Proposed host
capabilities in the contract are requirements, not claims of host support.

## One certification command

From the repository root:

```sh
node integrations/tooling/certify.mjs            # same as --layer js
```

This discovers every integration with a `package.json` (today `money`,
`notion` and `pets`), validates required metadata/files, checks the committed
bundle against a fresh build, typechecks and runs fixture tests. `--layer js`
is the default. `--layer sandbox` or `--layer all` (selected explicitly) also
runs exact named Rust tests through QuickJS/WASM, which the current pin no
longer has (see [Local setup](#local-setup)). Store evidence
(`tooling/evidence.mjs`) accepts only an `all`-layer report, so a default run
never produces it.
It fails if a requested test matches nothing. It never rebuilds the shipped file
in place to make a reproducibility failure disappear.

Options: `--integration notion`, `--layer js|sandbox|all` (default `js`), and `--output /path`.
Default output: `artifacts/integration-certification/report.json` plus logs and
Vitest JSON. Use separate output directories for concurrent runs. A report is
marked running until finished; failed validation replaces old successful evidence.

A passing report certifies only its selected offline layer. Capabilities are
labelled **declaredCapabilities**, not individually verified promises. `live` is
always `not-run`: existing live-test environment switches are stripped. Missing
credentials and skipped tests never count as successful live verification.
The report binds evidence to the shipped bundle hash and package version.
Do not infer compatibility of a later release from an older report.

CI's "Lint, tooling tests, certification" job runs `--layer js` for all
providers and uploads the report as the `integration-certification-report`
artifact. That report deliberately does not claim any sandbox layer ran.
Drive apps (`<name>/app/`) and packages without a `package.json` are not
certified by this command; their evidence is their lane's unit and e2e tiers
(`lanes.json`).

## Declaring config

A plugin that reads `ctx.config` declares the shape it needs in its `manifest`,
beside the code that destructures it:

```js
export const manifest = {
  schemaVersion: 1,
  operations: [],
  secrets: [],
  config: {
    // Key this plugin's config sits under in the installation's stored config.
    // Omit it when the config is stored flat.
    key: 'pets',
    properties: {
      table: { type: 'string', description: 'Table the pets are written to' },
      properties: { type: 'object' },
    },
    required: ['table'],
  },
};
```

The host builds `ctx.config` once for preview, manual runs and scheduled runs
alike, and checks it against this declaration before starting the sandbox. An
installation that never stored its config then pauses on a problem naming the
field to set, instead of on whatever `run()` throws when it destructures
`undefined`. The declaration is optional: a plugin that omits it is run exactly
as before, so guard `ctx.config` in `run()` too.

## Version and catalog entry

Each bundled package's `package.json` `version` is this repo's record of which
published version of that integration is currently shipped. When a
`catalog.json` card's `shortname` matches the package directory name (as it
does today for `money`, `notion` and `pets`), that card also carries a
`version` field and it must equal the package's. `certify.mjs` enforces this
alongside the existing bundle/owner/apiVersion checks, so the catalog can
never advertise a version other than the one actually shipped. A card whose
`shortname` differs from any package directory — reached through `pluginUrl`
or the generic LocalThought/Devonian bridge — carries no `version` here,
since this repo is not the source of its published releases.

A host is meant to read a package's `version` (directly, or via
`catalog.json`) at install time to record which release an installation is
pinned to, and later compare it against this repo's current `version` to
offer an update. No host does this at the current pin
([#94](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/94)). Bump
`package.json` `version` (and the matching catalog entry) whenever an
integration's shipped `plugin.js` changes.

The same card carries `requires` when the package's manifest is version 3 or
needs the `plugin-routes` feature: the sorted list the host derives from the
manifest (ontola/atomic-server#1732), for example `["persistent-host",
"plugin-routes:read-only", "public-origin", "wasm-sandbox"]`. Nobody writes
it by hand. `tooling/catalog-requires.mjs` reads the `manifest` each
`integrations/<id>/plugin.js` exports and derives the list with
`tooling/manifest-http.mjs`, a port of the host's rules that runs the host's
own shared fixtures (`tooling/fixtures/plugin-manifest/`, copied from the
commit named in `source.json` there):

```sh
node integrations/tooling/catalog-requires.mjs write   # after a manifest change
node integrations/tooling/catalog-requires.mjs check   # what CI checks
```

`certify.mjs` refuses a gated package whose card lacks it or disagrees. No
package here has a version-3 manifest yet, so no card carries it today.

## Publishing a drive app

A drive app (an `integrations/<id>/app/` whose `build.mjs` builds one ES
module exporting `view({ root, store })`) is installable from the catalog when
its entry carries:

| Catalog property                      | Meaning                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version`                             | As above: equals `integrations/<id>/package.json` `version`, or, in a folder with only an app and no certified package, a `private` `app/package.json`. |
| `app-module`                          | `https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/apps/<id>/<version>/ui.js`: the built module for exactly that version. Not `pluginUrl`, which links to source. |
| `app-module-integrity`                | `sha384-…` (Subresource Integrity) of those bytes.                                                                                                      |
| `app-row-name`, `app-row-name-plural` | Optional names for the app's table rows.                                                                                                                |

The host (atomic-server#1689, in the current `.atomic-server-ref` pin, not
yet merged upstream) lists these entries under **Drive apps** on the
Integrations page, with the same `enabled`/`experimental`/`requires-api-plugins`
gates as other entries. **Install** downloads `app-module`, refuses it unless
its bytes match `app-module-integrity`, and creates an ordinary app from it:
app, ontology, row class, table, entry point and app identity (`createApp`).
The app records its catalog id, installed version, module URL and integrity.
The card then shows **Installed <version>** and **Open**. When the catalog's
version is newer than the installed one it offers **Update to <version>**,
which replaces only the entry point's source (`updateApp`), so rows, schema,
identity and rights stay. It never offers a downgrade.

The module is committed to this repository at `apps/<id>/<version>/ui.js`.
GitHub Pages publishes `main` from the repository root (legacy build, with
the root `.nojekyll`, so files are served byte-for-byte), which puts it at the
`app-module` URL above. There is no separate publish step and no npm
package. Every released version keeps its own file and URL: installed apps
recorded that URL, so a version file that is on `main` is never changed or
deleted.

To release a new version:

```sh
# 1. change integrations/<id>/app/, then bump the version in both places:
#    integrations/<id>/package.json and its catalog.json entry
# 2. build into apps/<id>/<version>/ui.js and record its URL and integrity.
#    Refuses to overwrite a version that is already on origin/main.
node integrations/tooling/apps.mjs write <id>
# 3. confirm, as CI's shared checks do
node integrations/tooling/apps.mjs check --published origin/main
# 4. commit apps/<id>/<version>/ui.js with the catalog change
```

`apps.mjs check` fails when:

- an entry's `app-module` is not the Pages URL of `apps/<id>/<version>/ui.js`,
  or that file is not committed;
- the committed file's sha384 is not `app-module-integrity`;
- a fresh build of `integrations/<id>/app/` differs from the committed file
  for the current version, including after an atomic-server pin bump that
  changes esbuild's output (the fix is a new version once the old one is on
  `main`);
- anything under `apps/` is not an `<id>/<version>/ui.js` file;
- with `--published <ref>`: a file under `apps/` at `<ref>` was changed or
  deleted. CI passes `--published origin/main` on pull requests and in the
  merge queue. Locally it defaults to `origin/main` when that ref exists.

Builds pin esbuild's `absWorkingDir` to the repository root, so the bytes do
not depend on the directory the build ran from.

### Bundle size

The module is stored as a string property on a resource, so its size is
checked, not guessed at. The rule for every drive app:

- **Minify, JS and CSS.** `app/build.mjs` passes `minify: true` to
  `esbuild.build`. CSS that the module embeds as a string (a `<style>` it
  injects) is minified too, with
  `(await esbuild.transform(css, { loader: 'css', minify: true })).code`,
  using the same esbuild as the JS (`browser/`'s, from the pinned
  atomic-server).
- **The size limit is the measured size plus about 10%.** The
  `expect(bytes).toBeLessThan(...)` assertion in `app/build.test.ts` is the
  minified `bytes` that `build()` returns, rounded up by about 10%, and the
  line carries a comment stating the measured size and the date it was
  measured, for example:

  ```ts
  // Measured 41,212 bytes minified on 2026-09-24; limit is that plus ~10%.
  expect(bytes).toBeLessThan(45_400);
  ```

- **No silent headroom.** A round-number ceiling far above the real size
  (`160 * 1024` for a 40 KB module) hides growth until it is large. When a
  change pushes the module past its limit, re-measure, and raise the limit
  and the comment together in the same commit, so the growth is visible in
  review. Lowering it after a size win follows the same rule.

Not every app follows this yet: at the time of writing, the app builds on
`main` do not pass `minify` and their tests use round ceilings (64 KiB to
160 KiB). An app moves to this rule the next time its build or its limit
changes; a change of the build output needs a new version (see above).

Pages itself is mutable: anyone who can push to `main` can change a file
there. The host's integrity check is what makes that safe. A module that no
longer matches the catalog's pin is refused, and nothing is installed or
updated. The check does not catch a module and its pin changed together.
For changes that go through a pull request, `--published origin/main`
covers that case. A direct push to `main` skips it. After each Pages build,
[`apps-published.yml`](../.github/workflows/apps-published.yml) fetches every
catalog `app-module` and compares its sha384 with the pin.

Trade-offs, compared with an npm package per app:

- The repository grows by each released version's bundle, which is about
  50–100 KB (Pets 0.1.0 is 46,830 bytes, about 12 KB gzipped), and old
  versions are never removed.
- There is no CDN beyond Pages' own. Pages serves with
  `cache-control: max-age=600` and `access-control-allow-origin: *`.
- A merge is live only once Pages has deployed it, usually a minute or two
  later. Until then, installing the new version fails with a download error
  and nothing is created.

In the e2e lanes, `dev-server.mjs` stands in for Pages. It serves the
committed `apps/<id>/<version>/ui.js` files at `/apps/...` and points the
served catalog's `app-module` there, leaving the integrity as committed. The
host's check therefore still applies.

## Choosing a placement

Before writing code, decide where each part of a package runs. The full
rationale, the proposed manifest additions and the per-protocol assessment
are in the accepted design
[`docs/design/server-plugin-routes.md`](../docs/design/server-plugin-routes.md)
(sections 0 and 1, from [#88](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/88)).
This section summarises it for plugin authors. Only placements A and B, and
the class-extender hooks of D, exist at the current pin; everything else
below is **planned**, with the atomic-server issue that would build it.

- **A. Iframe view.** A drive app (shape 1 in
  [Plugin runtimes](../AGENTS.md#plugin-runtimes)), run in the user's
  browser in a null-origin iframe when a person opens it. Exists.
- **B. Sandbox job.** A sandbox plugin (shape 2), run in AtomicServer in
  QuickJS inside wasmtime on a `manual`, `cron` or `query` trigger. The
  runtime exists. At the pin, a file importer can be created as a draft
  from a published release and run from its plugin page's Import tab
  (atomic-server#1653), as `money/` is; publishing the bundle to a server
  is still manual ([#94](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/94)).
  [READINESS.md](READINESS.md) has the per-plugin state.
- **C. Sandbox route.** The same sandbox as B, invoked fresh for each
  inbound HTTP request from anyone. Planned and gated:
  ontola/atomic-server#1711–#1716 (phase 1: gates, manifest v3, catalog and
  install review, route registry, `http` trigger, well-known dispatcher),
  #1717–#1721 (phase 2: writes, keys and tokens, deliveries, blob bodies,
  endpoint health), #1722 (phase 3: WebSockets, design first).
- **D. Server extension** (`world: server-extension`). Runs in AtomicServer,
  installed by the operator. Class-extender hooks on reads and commits
  exist; raw listeners are planned, gated and design-first in
  ontola/atomic-server#1723.
- **E. Sidecar.** A separate daemon the operator runs next to AtomicServer,
  speaking its own protocol. It is outside AtomicServer; letting a plugin
  reach it through declared operations to a loopback address is planned,
  gated and design-first in ontola/atomic-server#1723.

A package may use several placements (a view **and** a job **and** routes);
decide each part separately. Answer these in order; the first "yes" sets the
minimum placement:

1. **Does it answer requests from another server or a remote client while
   no user of this drive is present?** Then C, or D/E if rule 4 also
   applies. A browser tab has no address and is not always on, so it cannot
   be a federation endpoint.
2. **Must it run when no browser tab is open** (a schedule, a trigger on
   data changes, retries of outbound deliveries)? Then B.
3. **Does it hold a credential that must not reach a browser** (a provider
   API key, a server signing key, an OAuth client secret)? Then B or C, with
   the credential in host secrets. Exception: a LocalThought connection's
   rotating code stays in the top page, so a view (A) may use it through the
   host's proxy relay.
4. **Does it need a long-lived connection it terminates itself** (a
   WebSocket firehose, a raw TCP/UDP/QUIC listener), memory that persists
   across requests, a non-HTTP port, or more sustained CPU than the route
   limits allow? Then D (native Rust, installed by the operator) or E. The
   sandbox starts fresh for every invocation and is meant to stay that way.
5. **Must it take part in reading or committing Atomic resources**
   (validation, derived properties)? Then D, a class extender. Never C.
6. **Otherwise** use A: interactive UI, reading the user's own connected
   accounts, local-first two-way sync through Devonian. A is the only
   placement that works on sessions without a server runtime.

Examples from the design: the Pets and Notion drive apps are A; Notion
scheduled sync and a bank-statement upload (`money/`) are B; a WebFinger
responder or a remoteStorage server is C; an ActivityPub actor is C (inbox)
plus B (delivery retries); an atproto PDS or Willow live sync (WGPS) is D or
E; a Willow drop-file import is B.

The design also proposes that the host **derives** a release's `requires`
list (ontola/atomic-server#1535) from these declarations instead of the
author writing it: a cron/query trigger implies `persistent-host`, non-empty
`secrets` imply `host-credentials`, and any route or well-known claim
implies `public-origin` and `plugin-routes:<level>`. That derivation is
planned in ontola/atomic-server#1712 (implemented in #1732, which the pin has);
this repo's catalog and certification support for it is
[#134](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/134), described at the
end of the next section.

### Public endpoints need a gated server

**None of this is implemented.** It is the accepted design (section 0), and
it applies to every surface that lets strangers reach a plugin: sandbox
routes (C), `/.well-known/` claims, inbound writes, host-held keys and
tokens, route-enqueued deliveries and wildcard-host egress, host-mediated
WebSockets, listeners and sidecar access. Such a surface needs **all three**
of these:

1. **Build gate.** AtomicServer compiled with the Cargo feature
   `plugin-routes`. It is not in `default` or `light`, and the release and
   atomic.place feature sets are meant to exclude it (a CI check for that is
   part of ontola/atomic-server#1711).
2. **Runtime gate.** The operator starts that build with
   `--plugin-routes <level>` or `ATOMIC_PLUGIN_ROUTES=<level>`, where
   `<level>` is `off` (the default), `read-only` (anonymous `GET`/`HEAD`
   routes and well-known claims; no inbound request can cause a write or an
   outbound request) or `read-write` (everything above). Listeners and
   sidecars additionally need `ATOMIC_PLUGIN_LISTENERS` /
   `ATOMIC_PLUGIN_SIDECARS` entries, and only at `read-write`. Setting the
   option on a build without the feature is meant to make the server refuse
   to start. Planned in ontola/atomic-server#1711.
3. **Install consent.** A person allowed to install plugins on that node
   approves the specific Installation after a review that lists every public
   endpoint. Bundled templates, auto-install and drive imports never carry
   that consent. Planned in ontola/atomic-server#1712 (refusal at install,
   upgrade and release pin) and #1713 (catalog marking and the review's
   "Public endpoints" section).

**atomic.place builds without `plugin-routes`**, so on atomic.place no
plugin can open a public endpoint, whatever its manifest or the install
review says; the design has its catalog hide such plugins there. Only a
self-hoster who builds with the feature, starts the server with the switch
and then approves the install gets one. A node whose gate closes after
install is meant to keep the Installation in a degraded state: routes answer
404, deliveries pause, and its views and ungated jobs keep working.

Nothing else is gated: views (A), jobs (B), class-extender hooks (D),
secrets, and outbound operations to fixed hosts work the same on every
build. A package that needs a gated surface should keep its ungated parts
(a view, a job) useful on their own, so it still does something on
atomic.place. The pinned atomic-server has the gates (#1726), manifest v3
(#1732), the route registry (#1749) and route execution (#1751), all
unmerged upstream; they exist only in a build with `--features
plugin-routes`.

**Tooling for gated packages** ([#134](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/134)):

- **Catalog.** A gated package's card carries the derived `requires` (see
  [Version and catalog entry](#version-and-catalog-entry)).
- **Certification.** `certify.mjs` refuses a gated package without that
  `requires`, and runs its sandbox tests on a build with
  `light,wasm-plugins,plugin-routes`, recording the feature in the report.
  `tooling/evidence.mjs` accepts evidence for a gated package only when the
  report also records the `--plugin-routes` level the server ran at, at least
  the one the manifest needs. Cargo tests are not a running server, so
  `certify.mjs` never records a level: a gated package's capabilities stay
  "declared" until live evidence at that level exists.
- **Lanes.** A lane can set `pluginRoutes` in `lanes.json` to a level (or a
  list of levels); its live and e2e tiers then run on a build with the
  feature, once per level (see [PARALLEL_LANES.md](PARALLEL_LANES.md)).
  The `plugin-routes` lane uses that to check, against a real host, that
  `tooling/fixtures/gated-plugin/` pins, installs through the review dialog
  and answers its `drive-prefix` route (`/_routes/<slug>/hello`) at
  `read-only`, and that at `off` pinning is refused, Install is disabled and
  that installation's handler no longer runs. It covers no other mount,
  no well-known claim and nothing that needs `read-write`.

## Building an uploader plugin

A file-upload importer — like **Bank statements** (`integrations/money/`,
which reads MT940 and camt.053 bank statement exports) — is not a special
plugin kind with its own base class or interface. It is an ordinary
server-executed sandbox plugin (see [Plugin runtimes](../AGENTS.md#plugin-runtimes))
whose `run(ctx)` reads file contents that UI code already collected, instead
of calling `ctx.http` against a provider. Everything else — config
declaration, `importRecords`, identity/reconciliation — is the same
contract every importer plugin follows.

At the current pin no host UI supplies the file text: atomic-server
`4bab16ee6` removed the upload dialog (`ImportMT940`) that did, and a
replacement is [#95](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/95).
The contract below is what `money/plugin.ts` implements and its unit tests
exercise.

1. **Declare no network access.** `operations: []` and `secrets: []` in the
   manifest is what marks a plugin as needing neither: contrast with
   `issue-tracker`/`notion`, which declare secrets and call `ctx.http`.
   File acquisition (choosing/reading the file) is UI code, not plugin code;
   parsing can run first in an isolated browser Worker, but the sandboxed
   `run()` itself never touches the network.

2. **Read the uploaded text from `ctx`.** The host hands file contents in as
   plain text on the trigger payload:

   ```ts
   const text = ctx.text ?? ctx.trigger?.payload?.text;
   if (!text)
     throw new Error('Open <Your importer> in Integrations and choose a file');
   ```

   Support a **dry validate** call before installation completes:
   `ctx.trigger?.payload?.validate` — when set, parse/validate and return
   `{ intents: [], problems: [] }` without writing anything.

3. **Declare and re-guard config.** Follow [Declaring config](#declaring-config):
   list the destination `table`/`rowClass`/ontology `properties` your
   importer needs under `manifest.config`, and mark them `required`. The
   host checks this before starting the sandbox, but the declaration is
   advisory — `run()` must still guard `ctx.config` and throw a
   configuration-shaped error (naming the missing fields), never let a
   destructure of `undefined` throw a raw `TypeError`:

   ```ts
   const { table, rowClass, properties: p } = ctx.config ?? ({} as Config);
   const missing = [
     ['table', table],
     ['rowClass', rowClass],
     ['properties', p],
   ]
     .filter(([, value]) => !value)
     .map(([name]) => name);
   if (missing.length)
     throw new Error(
       `Configure this importer before running it: missing ${missing.join(', ')}`,
     );
   ```

4. **Give every row a stable identity, keyed by what makes reimport safe.**
   File-based sources have no server-assigned ID to key off, so build one
   from content that uniquely identifies a row within your source scope
   (account/currency/format plus a bank reference, or statement position as
   a fallback), and a separate content fingerprint to detect a genuinely
   conflicting reimport versus a harmless repeat. `money/plugin.ts` is the
   reference: it keys `identity` by `[format, account, currency, reference-or-statement-position]`
   and a parallel `fingerprint` by the row's actual field values, throwing
   when the same identity carries two different fingerprints within one
   file (a real conflict), and rejecting overlapping imports that lack
   unique references at all. Feed the result to the shared reconciliation
   helper:

   ```ts
   import {
     importRecords,
     type ImportRecord,
   } from '../../browser/lib/src/import-records.js';
   const records: ImportRecord[] = rows.map(row => ({
     sourceId: identity,
     mode: 'append',
     legacy: { property: p['source-id'], value: identity },
     localId: `row-${records.length}`,
     parent: table,
     isA: [rowClass],
     values: {
       /* ... */
     },
   }));
   const result = importRecords(ctx, records);
   return { intents: result.intents, problems: result.problems };
   ```

   `importRecords` (`browser/lib/src/import-records.js`) is the shared
   import/reconciliation contract point every importer calls, whether the
   source is a file (`money`, `pets`) or a fetched provider (`issue-tracker`,
   `notion`, the generic `localthought` plugin).

5. **Keep parsing pure and separate from the manifest.** `money/parser.ts`
   (MT940), `money/camt053.ts` (camt.053 XML — the sandbox has no
   `DOMParser`, so this carries its own namespace-agnostic reader) and
   `money/statement.ts` (format detection + dispatch) contain no manifest or
   `ctx` references at all; `plugin.ts` only wires their output into
   `ImportRecord`s. This keeps the parser unit-testable without a sandbox
   host and reusable if a second file format needs the same importer later.
   Represent amounts, dates and other precision-sensitive fields as exact
   strings (`money/parser.ts` reconciles balances with `BigInt`, never
   floating point).

6. **Declare the destination ontology in a `schema.ts`.** A code-first
   `SchemaSpec` (`money/schema.ts`'s `bankingSchema()`): an array of
   `[shortname, displayName, description]` triples turned into `properties`,
   plus one or more `classes` entries with `requires`/`recommends`. This is
   what a fresh installation provisions before the importer's first run.

7. **Follow package layout and commands.** `plugin.ts` (manifest + `run`),
   `<domain>.ts` parser/adapter modules, `schema.ts`, `tsconfig.json`
   extending `../../browser/tsconfig.build.json`, `vitest.config.ts`,
   `package.json` with `atomicCertification`, and a `README.md` with an
   `## Architecture` and `## Supported scope and gaps` section (state exact
   limits — record counts, byte sizes — and what is out of scope, don't
   just describe what works). Bundle and test exactly as `money` does:
   ```sh
   ./browser/node_modules/.bin/vitest run --config integrations/<name>/vitest.config.ts
   ./browser/node_modules/.bin/esbuild integrations/<name>/plugin.ts --preserve-symlinks --bundle --format=esm --platform=neutral --target=es2022 > integrations/<name>/plugin.js
   ```
   Then run the full certification command from [above](#one-certification-command)
   and add a `catalog.json` entry (see [Adding or changing an integration](#adding-or-changing-an-integration)).

## Building a LocalThought (reflector/syncables/Devonian) connector

A provider integration today is a **drive app**: shape 1 in
[Plugin runtimes](../AGENTS.md#plugin-runtimes). It runs in the browser, in
the App's iframe, against the provider's HTTP API through **LocalThought**
(the OAuth/API proxy at `https://localthought.io`, or a self-hosted
[`integration-proxy`](../integration-proxy/)). `pets/app/` is the smallest
working example and `notion/app/` the fullest; both pass a host E2E against
the pinned atomic-server and the shared mock proxy. This section explains
where **syncables**, **Devonian** and **reflector** fit.

Earlier versions of this section described a different runtime: a
LocalThought connect dialog and sync panel inside atomic-server's
data-browser, built on `BrowserIntegrations` (`localthought/browser.ts`),
with catalog `platform` entries, lens hooks and the generic sandbox mapper
`localthought/plugin.ts`. atomic-server removed that flow (`f3efedf65`,
`c707ca4ed`), and the data-browser no longer imports anything from this
repo. `browser.ts` and `settings.ts` spoke the proxy's rotating connection
codes, which #54 retired; they were deleted in #54 phase 2.
[`localthought/README.md`](localthought/README.md) says what is left.

### The stack, top to bottom

- **LocalThought / integration-proxy** — the OAuth/API proxy. It owns
  provider credentials (never the frame, the drive or AtomicServer),
  publishes a **catalog** of supported platforms, and serves each platform's
  OpenAPI document, already patched with the overlays it needs (see below).
- **The host's proxy access** (#54 phase 2; ontola/atomic-server#1696
  and #1697, in the pin). The proxy account is the user's Atomic agent. A
  **connection** (platform + sealed provider token) lives at the proxy and
  belongs to the agent that redeemed it; a **delegation** says "this app's
  agent may use connection C". The app's frame keeps using
  `store.proxy.request({ platform, connectionId, path, method, query, body, ifMatch })`
  and gets `{ status, headers, body }`; what changed is underneath:
  - `store.proxy.connect({ platform })` draws the host's consent bar. If
    the person already has a connection for the platform, the bar offers
    "Use existing connection": the page delegates it to the app and
    `connect` resolves `{ status: 'connected', connectionId, platform }`,
    with no reload. Otherwise the page sends the tab to the proxy's
    `/connect` (no login, no `user_id`), and back to `/app/integrations`,
    where it redeems the handoff with a request signed by the user's key
    (the signer becomes the owner) and delegates the connection to the
    app's agent (`GET /app-agent`); the view reloads and `connect` never
    settles. A cancel resolves `{ status: 'cancelled' }`.
  - `store.proxy.connections({ platform })` lists the connections the
    person delegated to this app, from the proxy's `GET /connections`.
  - For `request`, view-client.js makes a non-extractable Ed25519 key in
    the frame's memory, asks the page for a **capability** for it (signed
    by the user's key after the page checked the delegation; at most
    10 minutes at the pin, 15 at the proxy), and calls
    `{proxy}/proxy/{connection_id}/{platform}{path}` itself, with
    `Authorization: Capability …` and an Atomic v2 request signature by the
    frame key (method, full URL, timestamp, body hash). It mints a new
    capability once on `401 capability_expired`.
  - The proxy's own refusals come back as responses, `{ error, message }`
    with an `integration-proxy/src/api_error.rs` code (`not_delegated`,
    `unknown_connection`, …). Each app's transport throws them rather than
    treating them as the provider's answer (`proxyRefusal` in
    `pets/app/transport.ts` and its siblings); a lost delegation or a
    deleted connection says "Connect again".
    **Nothing credential-like reaches the frame's own code or the graph.**
    The page's localStorage holds only a PKCE verifier for the ten minutes of
    a handoff. Never write a connection code, capability or verifier into an
    Atomic resource: a resource syncs and its drive can be shared
    ([#21](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/21)).
    `localthought/no-credentials-in-graph.test.mjs` (`node --test`, run by
    CI's "Tooling unit tests" step) fails the build if shipped source under
    `integrations/` contains a property URL naming a connection code,
    capability or code verifier, mentions the retired `x-connection-code`
    header, or signs requests itself (`x-atomic-signature`, the capability
    prefix): that is the host's job. It is a text scan, not data-flow
    analysis.
- **Syncables** — the npm `syncables` package, used in the frame as
  `syncables/browser` (`readPlatform`, `describePlatform`, a `Transport`
  over `store.proxy.request`). It reads an OpenAPI document plus its
  [CRUD Causality Extension](https://github.com/pondersource/openapi-extensions/tree/main/spec/crud-causality)
  (`components.crudResources`) block, discovers the resource model and
  pages through it, so the app carries no provider-specific paging code.
  Each app bundles the document it reads (`pets/app/openapi.json`,
  `notion/catalog/notion.json`) and pins an exact `syncables` version in its
  own `package.json`/`pnpm-lock.yaml`; this repo's `syncables/` source is
  not bundled.
- **Devonian** — the npm `devonian` package's lenses, for the mapping from
  provider records to Atomic rows (and back, for two-way). `notion/app/`
  uses its `AtomicLens` (`notion/devonian/notion/`). A plugin's own lens
  lives in its plugin folder at `integrations/<plugin>/devonian/<platform>/`.
  Two-way Devonian sync with journalled writes exists only as the unhosted
  GitHub issues bridge (`issue-tracker/devonian/github-issues/`).
- **Reflector** ([`reflector/`](../reflector/)) — the sync-engine/plugin-runtime
  layer one level above syncables. No drive app uses it yet.

### Two shapes, pick one

**(a) Read-only import.** Model it on `pets/app/`: a `transport.ts` that
turns syncables' requests into `store.proxy.request` calls, throws the
proxy's own refusals, and refuses any URL outside the
document's `servers[0].url`; a `sync.ts` that creates one Property per field
under the app's ontology, adds them to the row class's `recommends`, and
upserts rows under the app's table keyed by a provider id; a `controller.ts`
and `main.ts` for a plain-DOM view; a `build.mjs` producing `dist/ui.js`
with a `build.test.ts` that checks the bundle has no `fetch`, storage or
`Authorization` handling. Add a mock-proxy fixture in
`integrations/<plugin>/fixtures/<platform>/` and an e2e spec, and give the
lane an `e2e` tier in `lanes.json`. What happens to local edits of imported
fields on refresh is not settled yet
([#97](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/97)).

**(b) Two-way sync.** Needed when local edits must flow back to the
provider. No drive app does this yet. The design to port is
`issue-tracker/devonian/github-issues/`:

- `bridge.mjs` — Devonian lenses and checkpointed three-way reconciliation.
- `ports.mjs` — native-Atomic and provider-side projections/transports.
- `proxy.mjs` — the integration-proxy transport and a labelled sample
  fixture.
- `target.mjs` — which Atomic drive the sync writes into and when that
  drive can be enumerated or written.

Give every native resource a stable identity independent of matching text
(explicit provider IDs bind existing rows; nothing infers identity from
title/body equality), journal writes before sending them (the provider side
has no idempotent create, so an uncertain/lost response must stop rather
than retry blindly), and treat a missing record as a conflict to resolve,
never an implicit deletion. `store.proxy.request` passes `method` and
`ifMatch`, so conditional `PATCH` requests are possible from a frame. A
thrown request (a lost response or a timeout) may have reached the
provider; a proxy refusal (`{ error }` with a proxy code) did not.

### Sandbox plugins and the proxy

A server-executed sandbox plugin (shape 1 in
[Plugin runtimes](../AGENTS.md#plugin-runtimes)) reaches the proxy with
`ctx.http`, not `store.proxy`. The pin has the host side
(ontola/atomic-server#1702, #1710, #1725): a manifest declares
`proxy: ["clockify"]`, its operations name `atomic-proxy:/clockify/<path>`
URLs, and the host resolves one to
`{--integration-proxy-url}/proxy/{connection_id}/clockify/<path>` for the
connection delegated to the installation (`ctx.connections`), signing it as
this node's agent for the installation. An `atomic-proxy:` request must
still match a declared operation.

**No plugin in this repo uses it yet.** The calendar, issue-tracker and
Notion sandbox adapters call the provider directly with a plugin secret
(`secrets`), and moving them to proxy connections is #54 decision 11's
later step. It also needs the page to register a node's agent as a runtime
of the installation (`POST /runtimes`), which #1700 lists as still to do.
The mock proxy accepts runtime-signed requests (`POST /runtimes`, then a
request signed by the runtime agent), and `serve.mjs` passes the mock's
origin as `ATOMIC_INTEGRATION_PROXY_URL`, but no lane exercises that path.

### OpenAPI overlays and the pondersource extensions

A provider's own OpenAPI document rarely declares the two things syncables
needs to drive it generically: which operations are CRUD on which resource,
and how its list endpoints paginate. Rather than fork the provider's spec,
LocalThought layers **overlays** on top of it — small YAML/JSON documents
following the [OpenAPI Overlay Specification](https://spec.openapis.org/overlay/v1.0.0.html):
a list of `{target: <JSONPath-ish string>, update: {...}}` or `{target,
remove: true}` actions, applied in order onto the resolved document (a later
overlay may refine what an earlier one added). `integration-proxy/` (this
repo's LocalThought proxy) is what actually applies overlays server-side;
[`syncables/src/openapi/overlay.ts`](../syncables/src/openapi/overlay.ts)
is a reference implementation of the same deliberately minimal subset —
`$`, dot-paths (`$.components`), and quoted-bracket segments
(`$.paths['/pets/{petId}'].get`); no wildcards or array indexing.

Two overlay-carried spec extensions from the
[`pondersource/openapi-extensions`](https://github.com/pondersource/openapi-extensions)
project do the actual work:

- **[CRUD Causality Extension](https://github.com/pondersource/openapi-extensions/tree/main/spec/crud-causality)**
  — adds `components.crudResources` (named resources with an `identity`
  URL template + path-variable bindings, and `collections` with their own
  list-query fixed params) and an `x-crud` block on individual operations
  (`action: list|read|create|update|delete`, `resource`, `collection`,
  `mode`, `patchFormat`, `addedFields`, `memberOf`, `removesFrom`). This is
  what a syncables engine reads to discover a platform's resource graph,
  including nested collections; see
  [`syncables/src/resources/discover.ts`](../syncables/src/resources/discover.ts)
  for the reference implementation.
- **[OpenAPI Pagination Schemes Extension](https://github.com/pondersource/openapi-pagination-schemes-extension)**
  — adds `components.paginationSchemes`, describing how the API paginates
  (cursor, offset, page, link-header, ...). Providers essentially never
  declare this natively either, so it is applied the same way, via an
  overlay. [`syncables/src/pagination/`](../syncables/src/pagination/)
  implements it, deliberately keeping scheme/role strings open-ended rather
  than closed enums, since the spec allows `x-` extension roles.

**[`overlays/`](../overlays/)** (migrated from `localthought/overlays`) is
the collection of ready-made overlay files for real providers, and its
`catalog.json` is what `integration-proxy` composes; GitHub Pages serves it
at `https://ontola.github.io/atomic-plugins/overlays/`. Note that this is a
top-level folder of this repo, so like `devonian/` it is not part of the
`integrations/` tree copied into an `atomic-server` checkout —
[`syncables/__tests__/fixtures/real-world/`](../syncables/__tests__/fixtures/real-world/)
vendors overlay and OpenAPI fixtures unmodified from it and from apis.guru,
with provenance in each file's header comment. When adding a new platform
connector, check there first for an existing overlay before writing a new
one; when you do write a new overlay, keep the same minimal-diff spirit —
patch what the provider's spec is missing, don't restate what it already
declares correctly.

Overlays are applied before an OpenAPI document reaches a drive app:
`integration-proxy/` (LocalThought) applies them server-side, and a drive
app bundles an already-composed document (`notion/catalog/generate.py`
composes Notion's from `overlays/notion.com/`). A native (non-browser)
caller of the `syncables` npm package can instead apply them itself via
`ClientConfig.document`/`.overlays` file paths — a convenience that only
exists off the browser/WASM path.

## Adding or changing an integration

1. For a sandbox plugin, supply `plugin.ts`, reproducible `plugin.js`,
   `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, README and `atomicCertification` in
   `package.json`. For a drive app, see
   [the drive-app shapes](#two-shapes-pick-one) and add its lane tiers to
   `lanes.json`. Update [READINESS.md](READINESS.md) in the same PR.
   A folder with its own `pnpm-lock.yaml` also gets a copy of
   [`pets/pnpm-workspace.yaml`](pets/pnpm-workspace.yaml) (its
   `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` lets pnpm 11+ install our own just-published
   `syncables`, `devonian` and `@tomic/*`). If pnpm 11+ then reports ignored
   build scripts, add an `allowBuilds` entry as
   [`notion/pnpm-workspace.yaml`](notion/pnpm-workspace.yaml) does.
2. Metadata identifies owner, support tier, pinned API version, supported scope
   and fully qualified Rust sandbox test names. A new package without metadata
   fails CI rather than silently escaping it.
3. Reproduce provider bugs with synthetic or scrubbed fixtures. Mock network
   replies, not the permission checks or execution engine. Include independent
   edits, conflicts, pagination, missing data and uncertain-write behavior.
4. Run the full certification command. Test installation and actual UI behavior
   when changing browser packaging; mapping tests alone cannot establish that.
5. Review changes to permissions, mappings and checkpoint formats. Existing
   connections stay pinned; an upgrade must preserve their bindings and pending
   effects. Code rollback is not reversal of remote writes.
6. Run bounded live checks in a dedicated vendor test account before promoting
   supported capabilities. Never use customer data as published fixtures.

LLM-generated contributions use exactly this path. An agent may propose a repair
and tests; passing tests do not authorize production permissions or publication.

## Store evidence and upgrades

After the full offline run, generate the repository evidence asset:

```sh
node integrations/tooling/publish-evidence.mjs artifacts/integration-certification/report.json
```

This writes `integrations/evidence.json` locally; it does not publish a release.
The command rejects partial, failed, stale or mismatched reports and requires
every current provider sandbox test. Review and commit the asset with the bundle.
These results contain no live-provider certification or per-capability claims.

The committed `evidence.json` (generated 2026-09-18) is historical: its
sandbox checks ran against an atomic-server from before `4bab16ee6`, which
removed those tests, so it cannot be regenerated at the current pin. The
store cards that used to display it (`IntegrationEvidence`) were removed in
the same commit, and nothing at the pin reads it.

atomic-server's own `sync_session_tests.rs`, against its `testdata/plugin-sync`
bundle rather than one from this repo, exercises a compatible code-only
upgrade with existing bindings and no duplicate writes. An unresolved approved effect blocks
replacement by an upgrade or rollback and resumes against its original release.
Changed mapping/checkpoint formats still need explicit migration tests.

## Remaining maintenance work

- Dedicated vendor sandbox accounts and a separately authorized live-test runner
  with fixture ownership, budgets, cleanup and secret isolation. Current manual
  live checks are recorded in planning, not fabricated as CI certificates.
  [The bounded run contract](./LIVE_TESTING.md) defines scope and cleanup; it is
  not yet an automated runner.
- Capability-to-test evidence mapping and verified third-party evidence delivery.
- Mapping/checkpoint migration tests and staged release rollout.
- Health monitoring, provider-change alerts and ownership escalation.
- Reusable provider fixture builders and UI installation coverage for both pilots.
- An app's signing key is node-local (upstream `atomic-server`, checked at
  `.atomic-server-ref`). Its public agent resource syncs; the secret half in
  `Tree::AppAgent` does not, and nothing carries it to another node
  (activating a JS Installation there mints a _different_ agent instead). A
  node that received the drive by sync reads the missing key as legacy. There,
  `POST /app-write` refuses with "no key of its own", and a scheduled or
  plugin run signs as that node's own agent rather than the app. Treat
  app writes and unattended runs as single-node until upstream decides the
  "second node" question in its `planning/plugins.md`
  ([#41](https://github.com/ontola/atomic-plugins/issues/41)).

No recurring live jobs or automatic releases are enabled by this command.

Shared provider sign-in supports direct and managed deployments; see
[authorization service setup](AUTHORIZATION.md) for the common FOSS transport,
per-server provisioning, credential handling and current limits.

## Portable package resources (initial library API)

`@tomic/lib` can import an app definition from a standalone JSON document. See
[`app-package.json`](../browser/lib/src/fixtures/app-package.json) for the format:
metadata, a revision URI, the existing `PluginRelease` payload, and optional
validated setup metadata. No provider module needs to be imported by the host.

```ts
import {
  appPackageSchema,
  ensureSchema,
  prepareAppPackageImport,
  planVerdict,
  planHostFromStore,
} from '@tomic/lib';

const schema = await ensureSchema(store, drive, appPackageSchema());
const verdict = prepareAppPackageImport(
  importHost,
  json,
  packageFolder,
  schema,
);
const plan = await planVerdict(verdict, planHostFromStore(store));
// Show this plan for review, then use the existing applyPlan path.
```

`importHost` must read authoritative destination resources, as with other shared
imports; an incomplete UI collection is not sufficient for duplicate detection.
`readAppPackage(resource.getPropVals(), schema)` reads back the portable document.
The content uses canonical JSON text so generic graph-reference rewriting cannot
alter code or literal setup text. Top-level display labels reserve the `local:`
prefix, matching the importer. The document limit is 4 MiB.

Import produces an inert `app-package` resource under the host-chosen parent.
Repeated imports reuse its native localId. Use a new revision URI for changed
content; reusing one causes a conflict. That URI is an import identity, not a
verified signature or server release hash. Metadata is untrusted, and importing
never executes source. Package authors must not embed secrets in source/data.

The package-supplied manifest must still be compared with the sandbox-extracted
manifest during activation. Fresh installation identity, host-held credentials,
consent and schedule activation belong to installation, never the distributed
document. Imported packages are not yet exposed in the store UI or installable
through a generic sandbox setup. Schema bindings currently refer to external
resources; bundled schema/template graphs remain future work.

## Executable Node test lanes

Portable QuickJS-compatible modules can use the `node` lane tier for executable
unit and adapter tests. Declare an explicit non-empty `nodeTests` list of
`integrations/<lane>/*.test.mjs` paths in `lanes.json`. The runner checks the files
exist and invokes Node's built-in test runner; a failing suite fails that lane.
No browser workspace or package install is required for dependency-free suites.

```sh
node integrations/tooling/run-lane.mjs <lane> --tier node
```

This tier tests JavaScript behavior; it does not certify execution in the actual
QuickJS host, route authorization or storage persistence. Keep host integration
evidence separate and replace the `contract` scaffold tier when executable
implementation tests are present.
