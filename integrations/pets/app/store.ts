/**
 * The `store` a drive plugin's `view({ root, store })` receives, provided by
 * the host at runtime (atomic-server `server/src/plugins/assets/view-client.js`,
 * served from `/plugin-ui?format=client`) and never bundled here. Kept in
 * sync with that file by hand; if they disagree, view-client.js is ground
 * truth.
 *
 * A copy of `integrations/timesheets/app/store.ts`, extended with
 * `connections`, `connect`, response `headers` and request `method`/`body`.
 * Kept per plugin on purpose (strict per-plugin containment); sharing one
 * copy is a maintainer decision, see README.md.
 *
 * `proxy` (ontola/atomic-plugins#54 phase 2): the frame names a platform and
 * a connection id, never a credential. view-client.js makes an Ed25519 key in
 * the frame's memory, gets a short-lived capability for it from the page
 * (signed with the user's key, after the page checked the connection is
 * delegated to this app), and calls the integration proxy directly, signing
 * each request with that key. It is feature-detected, never assumed.
