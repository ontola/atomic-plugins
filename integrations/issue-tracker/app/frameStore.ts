/**
 * The frame's `PluginStore`, shaped as the data-browser store that
 * `AtomicPort` and `target.mjs` (devonian/github-issues) were written
 * against, so the bridge's Atomic side runs unchanged inside the app.
 *
 * What the host does at the pin (atomic-server bae5cdbe3), and what this
 * adapter adds because of it:
 *
 * - Writes. `newResource` and `save` are signed POSTs to `/app-write` that
 *   the host page awaits and rejects on any non-2xx (hostStore.ts
 *   `writeAsApp`). A resolved call means AtomicServer accepted the commit;
 *   a rejection surfaces as the host's error, never as a queued write. So a
 *   resource reports `idle` unless it has a `set` that no resolved `save`
 *   has sent yet, and nothing is ever local-only.
 * - Reads do not see the app's own writes. `getResource` and `query` are
 *   answered from the host page's store, and the e2e showed a resource the
 *   page had already loaded still reading its old values 5 s after the app
 *   saved it (a property the app wrote, on a row a person had edited in the
 *   page). Without a correction, the Bridge's verify-after-write would call
 *   that a concurrent edit. So every value the app saves is kept in
 *   `overlay` with the value it replaced: a read that still shows the
 *   replaced value gets the saved one instead; a read that shows the saved
 *   value, or anything else (someone changed it since), drops the entry and
 *   is believed. Known gap: someone setting the value back to exactly what
 *   the app replaced looks like a stale read until the page catches up.
 *   `overlay` should live as long as the view (the page's cache does).
 * - `query` is OPFS-first (`Collection.fetchPage`): it can miss a resource
 *   the page has not synced yet, and it swallows a failed server fallback.
 *   So every subject this adapter has created or listed is remembered per
 *   `(property, value)` in `known` (persisted by the caller) and added back
 *   when the host leaves it out, after re-reading it and checking the
 *   property still has that value. That keeps a bound row from looking
 *   deleted and a created row from being created twice. Rows the page has
 *   never seen show up on a later pass; the Bridge never treats absence as
 *   deletion.
 *
 * Not verified beyond the e2e: repositories past the Collection's
 * 500-per-page paging, and whether the page's cache ever catches up by
 * itself (the overlay does not depend on it).
