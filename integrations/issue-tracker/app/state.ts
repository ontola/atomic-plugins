/**
 * The Bridge's snapshot and the transport's write journal, kept as JSON text
 * on the app's sync resource (see tracker.ts). A null-origin frame has no
 * IndexedDB or localStorage, so this is the only durable place the app has.
 *
 * Write ordering, which is what makes this safe to resume:
 * - A journal entry is written before its GitHub request leaves
 *   (`saveJournal`, called by `proxyTransport` before and after each write).
 * - A Bridge checkpoint that carries a pending operation is written before
 *   that operation touches either side (`saveSnapshot`). Checkpoints without
 *   one (a baseline moving after both sides already agree) are only marked
 *   dirty and written by `flush()` at the end of the pass: losing them
 *   costs a re-check next pass, never a duplicate write.
 * - An import (a GitHub issue or comment new to the table) checkpoints no
 *   pending operation at all (bridge.mjs); `runPass` flushes every
 *   `IMPORT_FLUSH_EVERY` imports or `IMPORT_FLUSH_MS`, so a reload resumes
 *   from there. Rows imported after that flush bind back by their issue
 *   number or comment id.
 *
 * Not guarded: two tabs or devices syncing the same app at the same moment.
 * The resource syncs across devices and `/app-write` has no compare-and-swap,
 * so the last writer's state wins. One syncing tab per app is assumed.
