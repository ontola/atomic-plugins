/**
 * Per-folder npm dependencies, installed on demand for local runs.
 *
 * A plugin that bundles published npm packages pins them in its own
 * package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml (integrations/notion/, integrations/pets/,
 * integrations/issue-tracker/app/, …), and a lane that declares shared
 * `paths` in lanes.json imports that package from source (devonian/). CI
 * installs every one of those lockfiles before certify.mjs and run-lane.mjs
 * run ("Install plugin npm dependencies" in .github/workflows/ci.yml). A
 * local checkout usually has not, and the resulting failure — a vitest or
 * tsc "Cannot find module" — does not say what is missing.
 *
 * installMissing() runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in each given folder
 * that has a pnpm-lock.yaml and no node_modules, printing one line per
 * install. A folder that already has node_modules is left alone, so on CI,
 * where the install step ran first, this does nothing: CI behaviour is
 * unchanged. It never updates a lockfile (`--frozen-lockfile`), and it does
 * not notice a node_modules that is present but stale — run
 * `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in that folder by hand.
