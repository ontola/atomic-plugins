/**
 * The `store` a drive plugin's `view({ root, store })` receives. It is
 * provided by the host at runtime (atomic-server's
 * `server/src/plugins/assets/view-client.js`, served from
 * `/plugin-ui?format=client`), never bundled here. These types are kept in
 * sync with that file by hand because there is no package to import them
 * from; if they disagree, view-client.js is ground truth. The Pets and Notion
 * apps keep their own copies (per-plugin containment).
 *
 * Checked against view-client.js and
 * `browser/data-browser/src/chunks/AppPage/hostStore.ts` at the pinned
 * atomic-server (`.atomic-server-ref`):
 * - `getApp()` resolves to the app's subject string, not an object.
 * - `save()` sends only the properties set since the last save, plus any
 *   removed with `remove()`; the host writes the removals as an `/app-write`
 *   `remove` and then sets the rest (atomic-server#1690). Afterwards the
 *   host re-reads the resource, so the next `get` sees the write.
 * - `proxy`: `request`, `connections` and `connect`. Since
 *   ontola/atomic-plugins#54 phase 2 view-client.js calls the integration
 *   proxy itself, with a capability from the page and a key only the frame
 *   holds; the frame names a connection id, never a credential.
 *   Feature-detected, never assumed.
