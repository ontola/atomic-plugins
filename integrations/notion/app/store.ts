 * The `store` a drive plugin's `view({ root, store })` receives from the host
 * (atomic-server `server/src/plugins/assets/view-client.js`). It is never
 * bundled here. The types are kept by hand in step with that file and with
 * timesheets'/pets' copies; there is no package to import them from yet. If
 * they disagree, view-client.js is ground truth.
 *
 * `proxy` (ontola/atomic-plugins#54 phase 2): the frame names a platform and
 * a connection id, never a credential. view-client.js makes an Ed25519 key in
 * the frame's memory, gets a short-lived capability for it from the page
 * (signed with the user's key, after the page checked the connection is
 * delegated to this app), and calls the integration proxy directly, signing
 * each request with that key. It is feature-detected, never assumed. Without it
 * the app says so and fetches nothing.
